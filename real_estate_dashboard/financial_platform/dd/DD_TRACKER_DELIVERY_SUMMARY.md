## 🔗 Integration with Financial Models

The tracker is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing models:

### DCF Model Integration
**DD Findings → Valuation Adjustments**

| DD Finding | DCF Impact |
|------------|------------|
| Customer concentration | → Lower revenue growth rate |
| QoE add-backs | → Increase normalized EBITDA |
| Working capital analysis | → Update NWC assumptions |
| Deferred maintenance | → Add one-time CapEx |
| Risk assessment | → Adjust WACC / discount rate |

**Example:**
```
Finding: Top 3 customers = 60% of revenue
Impact: High customer concentration risk
Adjustment: Reduce revenue growth by 2% (from 8% to 6%)
DCF Impact: -$10M enterprise value
```

### LBO Model Integration
**DD Findings → Deal Structure**

| DD Finding | LBO Impact |
|------------|------------|
| EBITDA quality | → Adjust entry EBITDA |
| CapEx requirements | → Update CapEx assumptions |
| Working capital needs | → Adjust NWC in Sources & Uses |
| Debt capacity | → Update leverage assumptions |
| Risk profile | → Adjust return hurdles |

**Example:**
```
Finding: Normalized EBITDA = $52M (vs $50M reported)
Impact: Higher debt capacity
Adjustment: Increase Term Loan B by $10M
LBO Impact: +2% IRR improvement
```
