- Anything that requires mitigation
- Anything you'll need to explain to IC/partners

**For Each Issue, Enter:**

| Column | Field | How to Fill |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| A | Issue ID | Auto-generated |
| B | Date Identified | When you discovered it |
| C | Workstream | Financial, Legal, Commercial, etc. |
| D | Issue Category | Revenue Quality, IP Dispute, etc. |
| E | Issue Description | **BE SPECIFIC** - explain the problem clearly |
| F | Severity | 1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High/Critical |

| H | Probability | 1=Unlikely, 2=Possible, 3=Likely |
| I | Risk Score | Auto: Severity × Probability |
| J | Status | Open / In Review / Mitigated / Closed |
| K | Proposed Mitigation | How to address/solve |
| L | Owner | Who's responsible |
| M | Target Resolution | Deadline |
| N | Notes | Updates, progress |

**Risk Score Guide:**
- **9:** Extreme - may be deal-breaker
- **6:** High - requires mitigation
- **4:** Medium - monitor
- **2:** Low - manageable

---

### 12. **Risk Assessment** ⚠️
**Purpose:** Aggregate risk view and heat map

**What You'll See:**

**Risk Rating Guide:**
- Severity: 1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High
- Probability: 1=Unlikely, 2=Possible, 3=Likely
- Risk Score = Severity × Probability
- 1-2 = Low Risk (Green)
- 3-4 = Medium Risk (Yellow)

Shows by workstream:
- # of High Risks (score ≥6)
- # of Medium Risks (score 3-4)
- # of Low Risks (score 1-2)
- Total Risks
- Weighted Score (average)
- Overall Rating

**How to Interpret:**
- **Multiple High Risks in One Category:** Deep dive needed
- **High Weighted Score:** May need price adjustment
- **"High Risk" Rating:** Consider walk-away scenarios
- **No Issues:** Either thorough DD found nothing, or DD wasn't thorough enough!

**Uses:**
- IC presentation (visual risk summary)
- Price negotiation (justify lower price)
- Deal structure (more escrow, longer earnout)
