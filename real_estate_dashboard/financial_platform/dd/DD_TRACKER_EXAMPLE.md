## Investment Committee Decision

### Recommendation: **GO**

### Rationale

**Strengths:**
1. **Strong Product-Market Fit:** 95% gross retention, 120% net retention demonstrates customer love
2. **Financial Quality:** QoE validated EBITDA, improving margins, strong cash generation
3. **Market Position:** #2 player in growing market with clear differentiation
4. **Management Team:** Strong operators, CEO committed to 3-5 year transition

**Risks (Addressed):**
1. **Customer Concentration:** Mitigated through long-term contract negotiations ongoing
2. **Technology Debt:** Budgeted $3.5M for infrastructure upgrade, manageable
3. **Cybersecurity:** SOC 2 program launched, expected completion Q1 2026
4. **Key Person Risk:** CEO retention agreement negotiated, succession plan in place

**Valuation:**
- Fair price at $247M (9.4x normalized EBITDA)
- LBO model shows 23% IRR at this price (above 20% hurdle)
- Multiple exit scenarios tested, all show attractive returns
- Margin of safety with conservative growth assumptions

### Conditions to Close

1. Top 3 customer contracts executed (3-year minimum terms)
2. CEO retention agreement signed (3-year, with performance incentives)
3. No material adverse change
4. Regulatory approvals obtained
5. Key employee retention agreements (VP Sales, VP Engineering)

---

## Results

**IC Decision:** APPROVED

**Final Terms:**
- Purchase Price: $247M
- Structure: 65% debt ($161M), 35% equity ($86M)
- Entry Multiple: 9.4x LTM Normalized EBITDA
- Projected IRR: 23%
- Projected MOIC: 2.7x

**Close Date:** 12/01/2025

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Early Document Request:** Getting docs early (Day 1) accelerated DD
2. **Systematic Tracking:** Nothing fell through cracks, all issues logged and addressed
3. **Regular Updates:** Weekly status meetings kept team aligned
4. **Integration Focus:** Thinking about valuation impact from Day 1

### Areas for Improvement

1. **IT DD Scope:** Should have engaged IT consultant earlier
2. **Customer References:** Took longer than expected to schedule, start earlier next time
3. **Management Access:** Limited CEO availability early on, set expectations upfront

### Value of DD Tracker

**Time Saved:**
- Eliminated need for weekly status emails (auto-dashboard)
- Centralized all issues/risks (no more separate spreadsheets)
- Quick IC memo prep (pulled directly from tracker)

**Quality Improved:**
- Nothing missed (systematic 140-item checklist)
- Issues tracked to resolution (accountability)
- Valuation impacts quantified (Integration sheet)

**Team Alignment:**
- Single source of truth
- Clear ownership (Responsible Party column)
- Real-time visibility (Executive Summary)

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Comprehensive:** 140 items covered all aspects of due diligence
✅ **Organized:** Clear workstreams, priorities, and ownership
