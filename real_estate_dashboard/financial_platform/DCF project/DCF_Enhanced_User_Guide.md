## 💡 Key Concepts

### Terminal Value
- Represents value after projection period
- Typically 60-80% of total value
- Two methods: Gordon Growth or Exit Multiple
- **Most critical assumption** - validate carefully!

### WACC (Discount Rate)
- Weighted cost of equity and debt
- Typical range: 6-12%
- 1% change = 15-20% valuation impact
- Higher risk = higher WACC = lower value

### Sensitivity Analysis
- Tests multiple assumption combinations
- Shows range of potential values
- Identifies key value drivers
- **Use this before finalizing valuation!**

### Scenario Analysis
- Bull/Base/Bear cases
- Probability-weighted outcome
- Better than single point estimate
- Professional investors use this approach

## 📋 Input Checklist

Before running the model, ensure you have:

**Required Inputs:**
- [ ] Current stock price and shares outstanding
- [ ] Cash and debt balances (from latest 10-K/10-Q)
- [ ] Tax rate (federal + state, typically 21-25%)
- [ ] Risk-free rate (current 10-year Treasury yield)
- [ ] Beta (from Bloomberg or calculate from comps)
- [ ] Cost of debt (weighted average interest rate)
- [ ] Revenue base and growth assumptions
- [ ] EBITDA margin assumptions
- [ ] Terminal value assumptions

**Recommended Inputs:**
- [ ] Historical financials (3-5 years)
- [ ] Comparable company data
- [ ] Recent M&A transactions
- [ ] Multiple scenarios (Bull/Base/Bear)

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Start Conservative
Use conservative assumptions initially. Better to be pleasantly surprised.

### 2. Validate with History
Compare your projections to historical performance (Historicals sheet).

### 3. Multiple Methods
Use DCF + Trading Comps + Transactions for triangulation.

### 4. Sensitivity Test
Review sensitivity tables - understand what drives value.

### 5. Terminal Value Focus
Most value comes from terminal value - spend time validating this.

### 6. WACC Precision
A 1% WACC change = 15-20% valuation change. Get this right!

### 7. Scenario Planning
Don't rely on single estimate. Model Bull/Base/Bear cases.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Valuation seems wrong
**Check:**
- Shares outstanding (in millions?)
- Debt and cash balances (current?)
- WACC (6-12% typically?)
- Terminal assumptions (reasonable?)

### Issue: #DIV/0! errors
**Check:**
- Shares outstanding filled in?
- Revenue values entered?
- EBITDA not zero?

### Issue: Formulas not calculating
**Solution:**
- Press F9 to recalculate
- Check Formulas → Calculation Options → Automatic

### Issue: Need to reset
**Solution:**
- Save backup of blank template first
- Delete input cell values (blue/yellow only)
- Formulas auto-recalculate
