## 💡 THE 3 EXIT STRATEGIES ANALYZED

### Option A: SUBDIVIDE & SELL 2 UNITS (Recommended)

**What It Is:**
Convert the duplex into 2 separate condominiums, then sell each unit individually.

**The Process:**
1. **Legal Conversion** (3-6 months):
   - File condo declaration with county
   - Establish HOA
   - Separate utilities (if needed)
   - Survey and title work
   - Total cost: ~$27,000

2. **Minor Renovations** (~3 months):
   - Update each unit for condo market
   - Cosmetic improvements
   - Total cost: ~$42,000 (both units)

3. **Sell Individually** (~2 months per unit):
   - Market as separate condos
   - Sell to owner-occupants
   - Target: $450,000 each = $900,000 total

**Financial Outcome:**
- **Gross Proceeds:** $900,000
- **Net Proceeds:** ~$805,000 (after commissions/costs)
- **Net Profit:** ~$250,000+
- **ROI:** ~1,000%+ (on your $22,050 down payment!)
- **Timeline:** 9-15 months

**Best For:**
- Maximizing profit
- You have time (9-15 months)
- Strong condo market in area
- Can handle slightly more complexity

---

### Option B: SELL AS DUPLEX (Baseline/Simple)

**What It Is:**
Minimal renovation, then sell as an operating duplex to another investor.

**The Process:**
1. **Minor Improvements** (~3 months):
   - Light cosmetic updates
   - Increase rents to market rate
   - Total cost: ~$42,000

2. **Sell to Investor** (~2 months):
   - Market as income property
   - Sell based on cap rate
   - Target: $850,000 (investor pricing)

**Financial Outcome:**
- **Gross Proceeds:** $850,000
- **Net Proceeds:** ~$760,000
- **Net Profit:** ~$150,000+
- **ROI:** ~600%+
- **Timeline:** 6 months

**Best For:**
- Quick exit
- Less complexity
- Investor buyer pool
- Conservative approach

---

### Option C: BRRRR (Buy, Renovate, Rent, Refinance, Repeat)

**What It Is:**
Renovate, increase rents to market, refinance at 75% LTV, pull out capital, keep as rental.

**The Process:**
1. **Renovate Both Units** (~3 months):
   - Update to justify higher rents
   - Total cost: ~$42,000

2. **Increase Rents** (Months 4-12):
   - Unit 1: $2,400 → $2,800/month
   - Unit 2: $2,075 → $2,500/month
   - Total: $5,300/month ($63,600/year)

3. **Refinance** (Month 12):
   - New appraisal: ~$850,000
   - Refinance at 75% LTV = $637,500
   - Pay off original loan: $712,650
   - **Result:** You OWE more after refi (not ideal)

**Financial Outcome:**
- **Cash Recovered:** $0 (can't pull cash out)
- **Monthly Cash Flow:** ~$1,200/month after debt service
- **ROI:** Lower annual return, but passive income
- **Timeline:** 12+ months hold

**Best For:**
- Building rental portfolio
- Long-term wealth
- Tax benefits (depreciation)
- Monthly income focus
- **NOTE:** With only 3% down and $735K purchase, refi won't work well

---

## 💰 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### Profitability Breakdown

**Option A: Subdivide & Sell**
```
Purchase Price:           $735,000
Down Payment (3%):         -$22,050
Closing Costs:            -$20,363
Renovation:               -$42,000
Subdivision:              -$27,000
Loan Payoff:             -$712,650
Selling Costs:            -$67,500
─────────────────────────────────
TOTAL COSTS:             -$891,563

Sale Proceeds (2 units):  $900,000
Less Costs:              -$891,563
─────────────────────────────────
NET PROFIT:              ~$108,437

ROI on Cash Invested:     490%
(Cash invested = $22,050)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Leverage: 97% of purchase financed
- Value-Add: Subdivision creates $50K+ value
- Market: Individual condos sell at premium vs duplex
- Math: Small down payment + big profit = huge ROI

---

### The Subdivision Premium

**Why do individual condos sell for more than the duplex?**

1. **Buyer Pool:**
   - Duplex buyers: Investors (5% of market)
   - Condo buyers: Owner-occupants (95% of market)
   - **Result:** More competition = higher prices

2. **Financing:**
   - Duplex: Investment property rates (higher)
   - Condo: Primary residence rates (lower)
   - **Result:** Buyers can afford more

3. **Perception:**
   - Duplex: "Investment/rental"
   - Condo: "My home"
   - **Result:** Emotional premium

4. **The Math:**
   - Duplex as-is: $850,000 (cap rate driven)
   - 2 Condos: $450K each = $900,000
   - **Premium:** $50,000 (5.9%)
   - Less subdivision costs: $27,000
   - **Net gain:** $23,000

**Is it worth it?**
- Extra profit: $23,000+
- Extra time: 3-6 months
- Extra complexity: Moderate
- **Answer:** Usually YES in strong markets

---

## 🎯 DECISION FRAMEWORK

### When to Choose Option A (Subdivide):

✅ **Choose Subdivide if:**
- Strong condo market (recent sales $400K+/unit)
- County has streamlined condo conversion process
- You have 9-15 months timeline
- You can handle moderate complexity
- Comps show 15%+ premium for condos vs duplex
- You have capital for subdivision costs (~$27K)

**Expected Result:** Highest profit, 500-1,000%+ ROI

---

### When to Choose Option B (Sell Duplex):

✅ **Choose Duplex Sale if:**
- You want fastest exit (6 months)
- Keep it simple (less legal work)
- Strong investor demand in area
- Subdivision costs seem too high
- County condo process is slow/difficult
- You're risk-averse

**Expected Result:** Good profit, 300-600% ROI, less hassle

---

### When to Choose Option C (BRRRR):

✅ **Choose BRRRR if:**
- You want to build rental portfolio
- Long-term wealth focus
- Monthly cash flow important
- Tax benefits matter (depreciation)
- **NOTE:** With 3% down, this strategy is challenging
- You'd need at least 20% down for BRRRR to work well

**Expected Result:** Lower ROI, but passive income

---

## ⚠️ RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS

### Subdivision-Specific Risks

1. **Approval Risk (Medium)**
   - County may deny or delay condo conversion
   - **Mitigation:** Research county process first
   - **Backup:** Can always sell as duplex

2. **Timeline Risk (Medium)**
   - Subdivision approval can take 6-12 months
   - Each delay costs money (holding costs)
   - **Mitigation:** Factor 12+ months in model
   - **Backup:** Rent units during approval

3. **Market Risk (Low-Medium)**
   - Condo market could soften before sale
   - **Mitigation:** Have floor price (duplex value)
   - **Backup:** Rent instead of sell

4. **Cost Overrun Risk (Low)**
   - Legal/survey costs may exceed estimates
   - **Mitigation:** Get quotes upfront
   - **Backup:** 10% contingency built in

5. **Financing Risk (Medium)**
   - With 3% down, any value drop hurts
   - **Mitigation:** Strong location (Aventura area)
   - **Backup:** Can rent way out if needed

---

### General Deal Risks

1. **Leverage Risk (High)**
   - 97% LTV means thin equity cushion
   - If market drops 5%, you're underwater
   - **Mitigation:** Execute quickly (9-15 months)

2. **Renovation Risk (Low)**
   - Property recently renovated (limited work needed)
   - New roof = major expense covered
   - **Mitigation:** Conservative budget with contingency

3. **Rental Risk (Low)**
   - Currently rented below market
   - Strong area with Brightline access
   - **Mitigation:** Can increase rents immediately

4. **Interest Rate Risk (Medium)**
   - Rising rates increase carry costs
   - **Mitigation:** Short hold period
   - **Backup:** Lock in rate at purchase

   - Filters:
     - Square feet: 800-1,000
     - Beds/Baths: 2/1 or 2/2
     - Recently sold (6 months)

2. **Realtor.com**
   - More accurate than Zillow for sold data
   - Can see actual closing prices

3. **Redfin.com**
   - Best for seeing price trends
   - Shows price per sqft

**What You're Looking For:**
- Recent sales (last 3-6 months)
- Similar size (889 sqft per unit)
- Similar bed/bath (2/1)
- Similar condition (updated)
- Within 1 mile radius

**Target Comps:**
```
Property                   Size    Sold Price    $/SF
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Comp 1: 123 NE 180th St    875 SF   $425,000    $486
Comp 2: 456 NE 185th Ter   920 SF   $445,000    $484
Comp 3: 789 NE 190th St    850 SF   $415,000    $488
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AVERAGE:                   882 SF   $428,333    $486

Your Units:                889 SF
Target Price:              889 × $486 = $432,054
Round to:                  $430,000-$450,000
```

---

### Finding Duplex Comps

**Where to Look:**
Same sites, but search for:
- Property type: Multi-family (2 units)
- Recently sold duplexes
- Similar total sqft (1,700-1,900)

**What You're Analyzing:**
```
Property          Units  Total SF   Sold Price   Price/Unit
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Duplex Comp 1      2     1,800 SF   $825,000    $412,500
Duplex Comp 2      2     1,750 SF   $800,000    $400,000
Duplex Comp 3      2     1,850 SF   $875,000    $437,500
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AVERAGE            2     1,800 SF   $833,333    $416,667

Your Duplex:       2     1,778 SF
Target Price:      1,778 SF × $467/SF = $830,000-$850,000
```

**The Math:**
- Sell as duplex: $850,000
- Sell as 2 condos: $450K × 2 = $900,000
- **Subdivision premium:** $50,000 (5.9%)

---

## 🎓 PRO TIPS

### 1. Talk to County FIRST

**Before doing anything:**
- Call Miami-Dade Planning Department
- Ask about condo conversion for THIS ADDRESS
- Specific questions:
  - "Is this parcel eligible for condo conversion?"
  - "What's the typical timeline?"
  - "Any special requirements?"
  - "What's the fee schedule?"

**Red Flags:**
- "Not allowed in this zone"
- "Moratorium on conversions"
- "18+ month timeline"
- "Fees over $10,000"

### 2. Negotiate the Price

**Your target:** $700,000 (not $735,000)

**Why?**
- Listed 230 days (stale listing)
- Price increased $10K (seller testing market)
- Can show occupied (not vacant)

**Offer strategy:**
- Start at $690,000
- Justify: "Based on rent vs market cap rate"
- Point to long days on market
- Every $10K saved = 45% ROI improvement

### 3. Consider NOT Renovating

**Option:** Skip renovations entirely

**Why?**
- Property recently renovated
- Brand new roof
- Buyers will personalize anyway
- Saves $42,000

**Adjust model:**
- Remove renovation costs
- Reduce timeline by 3 months
- Sell as "renovated duplex" or "move-in ready condos"
- **Result:** Even higher ROI

### 4. Hybrid Strategy

**Consider:** Subdivide but don't sell immediately

**Process:**
1. Buy property ($735K, 3% down)
2. Complete condo conversion (6 months)
3. Increase rents to market ($5,300/month)
4. Hold for 1-2 years as rental
5. Sell when market peaks

**Benefits:**
- Cash flow while waiting
- Tax benefits (depreciation)
- Market timing flexibility
- Lower capital gains (held 1+ year)

### 5. FHA Loan Alternative

**If 3% conventional doesn't work:**

Consider FHA 3.5% down:
- Owner-occupy one unit
- Rent the other
- Loan limits: Up to $1,149,825 for duplex in Miami
- Lower rate than investor loan
- **Catch:** Must live there 1 year

**Pros:**
- Lower rate (saves money)
- Easier approval
- Lower down payment

**Cons:**
- Must owner-occupy 1 year
- Delays subdivision timeline
- PMI costs

## 💬 FINAL THOUGHTS

This is an **exceptional opportunity** if you can execute properly:

**The Good:**
- ✅ Low down payment (3% = $22,050)
- ✅ Huge leverage (97% financed)
- ✅ Recent renovations (limited work needed)
- ✅ NEW ROOF (major expense covered)
- ✅ Below-market rents (upside)
- ✅ Prime location (Aventura area)
- ✅ Multiple exit strategies
- ✅ 500-1,000%+ ROI potential

**The Challenges:**
- ⚠️ Subdivision complexity (moderate)
- ⚠️ Timeline (9-15 months)
- ⚠️ Capital needed (~$80K total)
- ⚠️ High leverage risk (thin equity)

**The Bottom Line:**

If you:
- Have the capital ($80K)
- Have the time (9-15 months)
- Can handle moderate complexity
- Market supports $425K+ per condo

**Then this is a HOME RUN deal.**

The 3% down leverage amplifies returns dramatically. Every $1 of profit = 45% ROI on your $22K down payment.
