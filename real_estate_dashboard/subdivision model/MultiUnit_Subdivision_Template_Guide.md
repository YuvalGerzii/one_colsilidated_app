## 💡 THE 5 EXIT STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: SUBDIVIDE/CONVERT & SELL INDIVIDUALLY

**What It Is:**
Convert multi-unit property into separate legal ownership units (condos, townhomes, co-ops) and sell each unit individually to owner-occupants.

**Process:**
1. Legal conversion (3-12 months)
   - File conversion documents
   - Establish HOA/co-op
   - Separate utilities if needed
   - Create individual titles
2. Renovation (2-4 months per unit)
3. Marketing & sales (1-3 months per unit)

**Financial Profile:**
- **Profit Potential:** HIGHEST (20-40% premium vs as-is)
- **Timeline:** LONGEST (9-18 months)
- **Complexity:** HIGHEST
- **Risk:** MEDIUM (market timing, approval delays)

**Best For:**
- Strong condo/for-sale market
- Premium location
- Units in good condition
- You have 12+ months
- Maximum profit goal

**Typical ROI:** 500-1,500%+ (on down payment)

---

### Strategy 2: SELL AS-IS (MULTI-UNIT INVESTOR SALE)

**What It Is:**
Minimal improvements, sell as operating multi-unit property to another investor based on cap rate/income approach.

**Process:**
1. Light cosmetics (1-3 months)
2. Increase rents to market
3. Market to investors
4. Sell on cap rate basis

**Financial Profile:**
- **Profit Potential:** MEDIUM (standard market value)
- **Timeline:** SHORTEST (3-6 months)
- **Complexity:** LOWEST
- **Risk:** LOW (straightforward transaction)

**Best For:**
- Quick exit needed
- Simple transaction preferred
- Investor buyer pool available
- Conservative approach
- Limited capital/time

**Typical ROI:** 200-400% (on down payment)

---

### Strategy 3: BRRRR (Buy, Renovate, Rent, Refinance, Repeat)

**What It Is:**
Renovate all units, stabilize at market rents, refinance at 75% LTV, pull out capital, keep as rental portfolio.

**Process:**
1. Renovate units (3-6 months)
2. Increase rents to market
3. Stabilize occupancy (6-12 months)
4. Refinance (30 days)
5. Hold long-term or repeat

**Financial Profile:**
- **Profit Potential:** ONGOING (cash flow + appreciation)
- **Timeline:** LONG-TERM (12+ months to refi, then hold)
- **Complexity:** MEDIUM
- **Risk:** MEDIUM (interest rate, occupancy)

**Best For:**
- Building rental portfolio
- Long-term wealth strategy
- Strong rental market
- Tax benefits important
- You purchased with 20%+ down

**Typical ROI:** 8-15% cash-on-cash annually + appreciation

**⚠️ Note:** Doesn't work well with 3-5% down (insufficient equity to pull cash out)

---

### Strategy 4: HYBRID (Mix of Strategies)

**What It Is:**
Combination approach - convert and sell some units, keep others as rentals, or phase conversion over time.

**Process:**
1. Identify best units for conversion
2. Convert/sell those units first
3. Keep remaining as rentals
4. Optionally convert more later

**Financial Profile:**
- **Profit Potential:** MEDIUM-HIGH (blended)
- **Timeline:** MEDIUM (6-15 months)
- **Complexity:** HIGH (managing multiple strategies)
- **Risk:** MEDIUM (diversified risk)

**Best For:**
- Market uncertainty
- Want optionality
- Test conversion demand
- Balanced risk/reward
- Phased execution preferred

**Examples:**
- 4-plex: Convert 2 to condos, rent 2
- 6-plex: Sell 4 individually, keep 2 for income
- Triplex: Sell 2, house hack 1

**Typical ROI:** 300-800% (blended based on mix)

---

### Strategy 5: WHOLESALE (Assign Contract)

**What It Is:**
Get property under contract at below-market price, assign contract to end buyer for a fee, never take ownership.

**Process:**
1. Negotiate purchase (7-14 days)
2. Market to investor buyers
3. Assign contract (+$10K-$50K fee)
4. Close with end buyer (30 days)

**Financial Profile:**
- **Profit Potential:** LOWEST (fixed fee)
- **Timeline:** FASTEST (30-60 days total)
- **Complexity:** LOWEST (no ownership)
- **Risk:** LOWEST (minimal capital at risk)

**Best For:**
- Found great deal, lack capital
- Quick profit needed
- No renovation capacity
- Building buyer relationships
- Testing market

**Typical Profit:** $10K-$50K (fixed assignment fee)

### STEP 5: EXIT STRATEGIES (20-30 minutes)

**Go to "Exit Strategies" sheet:**

This is the **most important analysis** - compare all 5 exit strategies to find the best one for your situation.

1. **Strategy 1: Subdivide/Convert (Rows 4-13)**
   
   **Enter:**
   - Individual unit sale prices
   - Get comps for similar condos/townhomes
   - Use $/SF from recent sales
   - Add 10-20% premium for new conversion
   
   **Formula calculates:**
   - Gross proceeds (all units)
   - Selling costs (6% commission + 1.5% closing)
   - Conversion costs (from sheet 4)
   - Net proceeds
   - Total project cost
   - Net profit
   - ROI
   
   **Target ROI:** 500-1,500%

2. **Strategy 2: Sell As-Is (Rows 4-13)**
   
   **Enter:**
   - Investor sale price (cap rate basis)
   - Pull duplex/triplex/quad comps
   - Use price per unit or cap rate method
   
   **Cap Rate Method:**
   ```
   Annual NOI ÷ Cap Rate = Property Value
   
   Example:
   Annual NOI: $40,000
   Market Cap Rate: 6.5%
   Value: $40,000 ÷ 0.065 = $615,385
   ```
   
   **Target ROI:** 200-400%

3. **Strategy 3: BRRRR (Rows 4-13)**
   
   **Enter:**
   - Stabilized property value (at 95% occupancy)
   - Refinance amount (75% LTV typical)
   - Cash-out proceeds
   - Annual cash flow
   
   **BRRRR Works If:**
   - Purchased with 20%+ down
   - Added significant value via renovation
   - Stabilized at market rents
   - New appraised value 125%+ of purchase
   
   **Target ROI:** 8-15% cash-on-cash + appreciation

4. **Strategy 4: Hybrid (Rows 4-13)**
   
   **Enter:**
   - Number of units to convert
   - Number of units to keep
   - Sale prices (converted units)
   - Rental value (kept units)
   
   **Example Scenarios:**
   - 4-plex: Sell 2 condos, rent 2 units
   - 6-plex: Sell 4 condos, rent 2 units
   - Triplex: Sell 2, house hack 1
   
   **Target ROI:** 300-800% (blended)

5. **Strategy 5: Wholesale (Rows 4-13)**
   
   **Enter:**
   - End buyer price
   - Your assignment fee ($10K-$50K typical)
   - Minimal holding costs
   
   **Wholesale Formula:**
   ```
   ARV × 70% - Repairs - Fee = Max Offer
   
   Example:
   ARV: $800,000
   Repairs: $100,000
   Your Fee: $25,000
   Max Offer: ($800K × 0.70) - $100K - $25K = $435K
   ```
   
   **Target Profit:** $10K-$50K fixed fee

6. **Compare All 5 (Row 14)**
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - ROI ranking
   - Timeline comparison
   - Risk assessment

**Decision Matrix:**

| Situation | Best Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Max profit, have time** | Strategy 1 (Subdivide) |

### STEP 5: EXIT STRATEGIES

Let's analyze all 5 options:

#### STRATEGY 1: SUBDIVIDE & SELL 3 CONDOS

**Comparable Condo Research:**
```
Recent Sales (2BR condos, 800-900 SF):
Comp 1: 875 SF, sold $385,000 = $440/SF
Comp 2: 850 SF, sold $375,000 = $441/SF
Comp 3: 825 SF, sold $365,000 = $442/SF
Average: $441/SF

My Units: 850 SF × $441 = $374,850
Conservative: $370,000 per unit
```

**Financial Analysis:**
```
REVENUE:
3 units × $370,000              = $1,110,000
Less: Commission (6%)           = ($66,600)
Less: Closing costs (1.5%)      = ($16,650)
Less: Staging (3 units × $2K)   = ($6,000)
NET PROCEEDS                    = $1,020,750

COSTS:
Cash at closing                 = $45,640
Renovation                      = $62,700
Conversion                      = $34,650
Loan payoff                     = $582,000
TOTAL COSTS                     = $724,990

NET PROFIT                      = $295,760
ROI (on $45,640 down)           = 648%
Timeline                        = 12-15 months
```

**Analysis:**
- HUGE ROI (648%) ✅
- Significant profit ($295K) ✅
- Longer timeline (12-15 months) ⚠️
- Execution complexity ⚠️
- **BEST OPTION IF:** Have time, strong condo market

---

#### STRATEGY 2: SELL AS TRIPLEX (AS-IS)

**Comparable Triplex Research:**
```
Triplex Comp 1: $750,000 (6.5% cap rate)
Triplex Comp 2: $725,000 (6.8% cap rate)
Triplex Comp 3: $775,000 (6.3% cap rate)

---

#### STRATEGY 4: HYBRID (Sell 2, Keep 1)

**Blended Approach:**
```
Convert & Sell Units 2 & 3:
2 units × $370,000              = $740,000
Less: Commission (6%)           = ($44,400)
Less: Closing (1.5%)            = ($11,100)
Less: Conversion (2 units)      = ($23,100)
NET FROM SALES                  = $661,400

Keep Unit 1 as Rental:
Rental value (cap rate)         = $275,000

TOTAL VALUE                     = $936,400

Less Total Costs:
Cash at closing                 = $45,640
Renovation                      = $62,700
Loan payoff (⅔)                 = $388,000
TOTAL COSTS                     = $496,340

NET PROFIT + RETAINED UNIT      = $440,060
Effective ROI                   = 964%
Timeline                        = 12-15 months
```

**Analysis:**
- Very high ROI (964%) ✅
- Keep income stream ✅
- Hedge your bets ✅
- More complex ⚠️
- **BEST OPTION IF:** Want passive income + profit

---

#### STRATEGY 5: WHOLESALE

**Wholesale Calculation:**
```
ARV (as triplex): $825,000
70% Rule: $825,000 × 0.70 = $577,500
Less: Repairs: $62,700
Less: Your Fee: $25,000
MAX OFFER: $489,800

You're buying at: $600,000
DOESN'T WORK ❌
```

**Alternative:**
```
If you got it under contract at $550,000:
Assignment fee: $25,000
Holding costs (60 days): $2,000
NET PROFIT: $23,000
ROI: n/a (no money in deal)
Timeline: 60 days
```

**Analysis:**
- Doesn't work at $600K purchase ❌
- Would need to buy under $490K ❌
- Quick profit if numbers work ✅
- **NOT AN OPTION** for this deal

## 🎓 CONVERSION STRATEGIES EXPLAINED

### CONDO CONVERSION

**What It Is:**
Transform a multi-unit property into a condominium where each unit can be individually owned and sold.

**Legal Process:**
1. File Declaration of Condominium with county
2. Create Condominium Association (HOA)
3. Record individual unit deeds
4. Establish CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions)
5. Separate utilities (if not already)
6. Get county approval

**Timeline:** 6-12 months

**Cost Range:**
- Duplex: $15K-$30K
- Triplex: $20K-$40K
- Quadplex: $25K-$50K
- 5-10 units: $50K-$100K+

**Best For:**
- Urban/suburban markets
- Strong owner-occupant demand
- Units similar in size/quality
- Good location
- Modern construction

**Pricing:**
Individual condos sell at 15-30% premium vs. property as-is

---

### TOWNHOME SUBDIVISION

**What It Is:**
Physically subdivide the lot into separate parcels, creating individual townhome properties with their own land.

**Legal Process:**
1. Survey property for lot line adjustment
2. File subdivision plat with county
3. Create separate legal descriptions
4. Establish shared area agreements (if needed)
5. Separate utilities
6. Get county approval

**Timeline:** 9-18 months (more complex)

**Cost Range:**
- Generally 50% higher than condo conversion
- Requires more extensive surveying
- May need infrastructure improvements

**Best For:**
- Suburban/rural areas
- Properties with adequate land
- Row houses or side-by-side units
- Buyers wanting land ownership
- Areas where condos stigmatized

**Pricing:**
Townhomes sell at 20-40% premium vs. multi-unit as-is

---

### CO-OP CONVERSION

**What It Is:**
Create a cooperative corporation where buyers purchase shares in the corporation, not the physical unit itself.

**Legal Process:**
1. Form cooperative corporation
2. Create proprietary leases for each unit
3. Establish board of directors
4. File with county
5. Issue shares
6. Sell shares (not real estate)

**Timeline:** 4-8 months (fastest)

**Cost Range:**
- Generally 40% less than condo conversion
- Simpler legal process
- Less common (harder to sell)

**Best For:**
- NYC and select urban markets
- Buildings with high-end units
- Sophisticated buyer pool
- Tax advantages for corporation

**Pricing:**
Co-ops sell at 10-20% premium vs. multi-unit (lower than condos)

---

### LEGAL SUBDIVISION (LOT SPLIT)

**What It Is:**
Physically divide the parcel into separate lots, each with its own building/unit.

**Legal Process:**
1. Survey and create subdivision plat
2. File lot split application
3. Ensure separate access for each lot
4. Separate utilities and infrastructure
5. Create new APNs (parcel numbers)
6. Get county approval

**Timeline:** 12-24 months (longest)

**Cost Range:**
- Most expensive option
- May require infrastructure improvements
- Street access, utilities, etc.
- $50K-$200K+ depending on scope

**Best For:**
- Large lots (can be physically divided)
- Detached units (not connected)
- Rural/suburban areas
- Buyers wanting maximum independence

**Pricing:**
Separate lots sell at 30-50% premium vs. multi-unit

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### 1. Not Checking Zoning BEFORE Buying

**Mistake:**
Buy property assuming condo conversion is allowed, find out after closing it's prohibited.

**Solution:**
- Call county planning department FIRST
- Ask: "Is condo conversion allowed at [address]?"
- Get answer in writing
- Make offer contingent on conversion approval

**Red Flags:**
- "Zoning doesn't permit"
- "HOA prohibits subdivisions"
- "Moratorium on conversions"
- "Previous conversion denied"

---

### 2. Underestimating Conversion Timeline

**Mistake:**
Assume 3-month conversion process, actually takes 12 months, blowing up your pro forma.

**Solution:**
- Add 3-6 months buffer to estimates
- Plan for worst-case timeline
- Have capital reserves for extended hold
- Consider selling as-is if delayed

**Reality:**
- County says: "6-9 months" → Plan for 12 months
- Attorney says: "4 months" → Plan for 6 months
- Always double timeline estimates

---

### 3. Not Getting Actual Contractor Bids

**Mistake:**
Estimate renovation at $15K per unit, reality is $30K per unit.

**Solution:**
- Walk property with 3 contractors
- Get detailed bids (not ballpark)
- Use HIGHEST bid (not average)
- Add 15-20% contingency
- Budget for unknowns (walls, foundation, etc.)

**Conservative Budgeting:**
```
Contractor A bid: $25,000
Contractor B bid: $28,000
Contractor C bid: $32,000

Use: $32,000 (highest)
Add contingency: $32,000 × 1.15 = $36,800
Budget: $36,800 per unit
```

---

### 4. Ignoring Legal/Conversion Costs

**Mistake:**
Focus only on purchase and renovation, forget $30K-$50K in legal fees.

**Solution:**
- Get attorney quote upfront
- Factor survey costs ($3K-$8K)
- Include title work ($1K-$2K per unit)
- Budget permit fees ($2K-$5K)
- Add 10% contingency to legal costs

**Typical Breakdown:**
```
Real estate attorney: $10,000-$15,000
Survey & engineering: $5,000-$8,000
Title work (per unit): $1,500-$2,000
HOA formation: $3,000-$5,000
Permits & fees: $2,000-$5,000
───────────────────────────────
TOTAL: $21,500-$35,000+
```

---

### 5. Overestimating Individual Unit Prices

**Mistake:**
Assume units will sell for 30-40% above as-is value, market only supports 15%.

**Solution:**
- Pull 5-10 recent condo comps
- Use conservative $/SF from comps
- Factor condition differences
- Consider conversion stigma
- Test market with one unit first

**Conservative Comping:**
```
Recent condo sales: $425/SF average
Your units: 850 SF
Conservative estimate: 850 × $400 = $340,000
(Use $400/SF not $425/SF for safety margin)
```

---

### 6. BRRRR with Low Down Payment

**Mistake:**
Buy with 3% down, plan to BRRRR, realize you can't pull cash out.

**Solution:**
- BRRRR requires 20%+ down minimum
- Need significant equity to refinance
- Must add value through renovation
- 75% LTV refi standard
- Run the math BEFORE buying

**Math Check:**
```
Purchase: $500,000
Down payment (3%): $15,000
After renovation value: $600,000
Refi at 75% LTV: $450,000
Original loan: $485,000

CAN'T REFI ❌ (new loan smaller than old loan)
```

---

### 7. Ignoring Market Cycle

**Mistake:**
Start conversion at market peak, try to sell 12 months later in downturn.

**Solution:**
- Monitor local market trends
- Check inventory levels
- Watch interest rates
- Have backup plan (rent units)
- Be flexible on exit timing

**Market Indicators:**
- **Strong market:** <3 months inventory, rising prices
- **Weakening:** 6+ months inventory, price cuts
- **Weak:** 12+ months inventory, falling prices

---

## 💡 ADVANCED STRATEGIES

### PHASED CONVERSION

**Strategy:**
Convert and sell units one at a time rather than all at once.

**Process:**
1. Buy multi-unit property
2. Renovate Unit 1
3. Convert Unit 1 to condo
4. Sell Unit 1
5. Use proceeds to renovate Unit 2
6. Repeat

**Pros:**
- Lower initial capital requirement
- Test market demand
- Adjust pricing based on first sale
- Less risk if market weakens
- Build track record

**Cons:**
- Longer timeline
- Multiple conversion processes
- HOA management while selling
- May have rental income gaps

**Best For:**
- Limited capital
- Uncertain market
- Large properties (6-10 units)
- First-time converters

---

### HYBRID WITH OWNER-OCCUPY

**Strategy:**
Buy 3-4 unit property with FHA 3.5% down, live in one unit, convert and sell others.

**Example:**
```
Buy triplex: $600,000
FHA 3.5% down: $21,000

Year 1:
- Live in Unit 1
- Rent Units 2 & 3
- Renovate Units 2 & 3
- File condo conversion

Year 2:
- Convert Units 2 & 3
- Sell Unit 2 for $370,000
- Sell Unit 3 for $370,000
- Keep Unit 1 as primary residence

Result:
- Started with: $21,000
- Sold 2 units for: $740,000
- Paid off loan: $582,000
- Keep Unit 1: Still own $370,000 condo
- Net cash in pocket: $158,000
- Still live there rent-free!
```

**Pros:**
- Lowest possible down payment
- Free housing while converting
- Keep 1 unit as primary residence
- No capital gains (primary residence exemption)

**Cons:**
- Must live there 1 year
- FHA property standards
- Slower timeline

---

### SELLER FINANCING FOR ACQUISITION

**Strategy:**
Negotiate seller financing to reduce upfront capital, use saved cash for conversion.

**Structure:**
```
Purchase: $600,000
Seller financing: 80% ($480,000)
Your down payment: 20% ($120,000)

Seller Note Terms:
- Interest only: 6%
- 2-year balloon
- No monthly principal payment

Monthly payment: $480,000 × 0.06 ÷ 12 = $2,400

Benefits:
- Lower payment during conversion
- More cash for renovations
- Flexible terms
- Fast close (no bank)
```

**When It Works:**
- Seller owns property free & clear
- Seller wants passive income
- Property needs work (banks won't finance)
- You're experienced investor
- Fast close needed

---

### WHOLESALE THE CONVERSION OPPORTUNITY

**Strategy:**
Find off-market deal, get under contract, market conversion opportunity to investor, assign contract.

**Process:**
1. Find distressed multi-unit property
2. Negotiate $450K purchase
3. Get under contract
4. Calculate conversion ARV: $900K (3 condos × $300K)
5. Market to investors: "Convert to 3 condos, make $300K"
6. Assign for $25K fee
7. Investor buys at $475K, you make $25K

**Pros:**
- No money in deal
- Quick profit (30-60 days)
- No execution risk
- Build investor relationships

**Cons:**
- Give up conversion profit
- Need to find buyer
- Assignment fees taxable as ordinary income

---

## 📊 KEY METRICS & BENCHMARKS

### Conversion Premium

**Target:** Individual units should sell for 15-30% more than property value as-is

**Formula:**
```
Conversion Premium = (Total Individual Sales - As-Is Value) ÷ As-Is Value

Example:
3 condos × $370,000 = $1,110,000
As-is triplex value = $825,000
Premium = ($1,110,000 - $825,000) ÷ $825,000 = 34.5%
```

**Benchmarks:**
- <15%: Not worth effort/cost
- 15-25%: Marginal, consider carefully
- 25-35%: Good opportunity ✅
- 35-50%: Excellent opportunity ✅
- >50%: Double-check comps (might be wrong)

## 🎓 FINAL WISDOM

**The Most Important Rule:**

**BUY RIGHT**

You make money when you BUY, not when you SELL.

If you buy at the right price, you have options:
- Subdivide for maximum profit
- Sell as-is for good profit
- Hold as rental for cash flow
- Wholesale for quick cash

If you overpay, NOTHING works.

**Target Purchase Price Formula:**
```
Individual Unit Sales × 70% - Renovation - Conversion = Max Offer

Example:
3 units × $370K = $1,110,000
70% = $777,000
Less renovation: $62,700
Less conversion: $34,650
MAX OFFER: $679,650

You should offer: $600,000-$650,000
Negotiate from there
```

**Remember:**
- The conversion is the easy part
- Buying right is the hard part
- Don't fall in love with a property
- Walk away from bad deals
- There's always another deal
