## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### The 4 Pillars of Success

**1. BUY RIGHT (70% Rule)**
- Purchase below 70% of ARV
- Less renovation costs
- Less conversion costs
- = Maximum purchase price

**2. VERIFY ZONING**
- County allows conversion
- Get approval timeline in writing
- Understand all costs
- Check for moratoriums

**3. GET ACTUAL BIDS**
- Walk property with 3 contractors
- Get detailed itemized bids
- Use HIGHEST bid for budget
- Add 15-20% contingency

**4. HAVE RESERVES**
- Budget 12 months carry costs
- Double all timeline estimates
- Plan for delays and surprises
- Have backup capital sources

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Not Checking Zoning First** - Call county BEFORE making offer
2. **Underestimating Timeline** - Always double time estimates
3. **Using Estimated Costs** - Get actual contractor bids
4. **Ignoring Conversion Costs** - Budget $20K-$50K for legal
5. **Overpaying on Purchase** - Use 70% Rule formula strictly
6. **Insufficient Reserves** - Need 6-12 months carry costs
7. **Poor Market Timing** - List condos in spring/fall, not winter
