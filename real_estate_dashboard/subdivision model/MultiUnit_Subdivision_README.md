## 💡 THE 5 EXIT STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: SUBDIVIDE/CONVERT & SELL INDIVIDUALLY

**What It Is:**
Convert multi-unit property into separate legal ownership units (condos, townhomes, co-ops) and sell each unit individually to owner-occupants.

**Process:**
1. Legal conversion (6-12 months)
   - File conversion documents
   - Establish HOA/co-op
   - Separate utilities if needed
   - Create individual titles
2. Renovation (2-4 months per unit)
3. Sales phase (2-6 months per unit)
4. Close out project

**Timeline:** 12-18 months total

**Pros:**
- Maximum profit potential (300-800% ROI typical)
- Sell to owner-occupants (higher prices)
- Multiple bites at the apple
- Can sell units as renovated

**Cons:**
- Longest timeline (12-18 months)
- Highest complexity
- Most capital intensive
- Conversion approval risk
- Market timing risk

**Best For:**
- Properties in strong owner-occupant markets
- Investors with 12+ month timeline
- Adequate capital reserves
- County allows conversions
- 20%+ conversion premium

**Target Numbers:**
- Individual units sell for 20-30% more than as-is value
- ROI: 500-1,500% on down payment
- Hold costs: $20K-$50K for conversion period

---

### Strategy 2: SELL AS-IS (MULTI-UNIT)

**What It Is:**
Purchase property, potentially do light renovation, sell to another investor as a multi-unit rental property.

**Process:**
1. Purchase property
2. Optional: Light cosmetic renovation
3. Stabilize tenants/rents
4. Market to investors
5. Sell as-is multi-unit

**Timeline:** 3-9 months

**Pros:**
- Faster timeline (3-9 months)
- Less complexity
- Lower capital requirements
- No conversion approval needed
- Can sell anytime if needed

**Cons:**
- Lower profit potential (150-400% ROI)
- Limited buyer pool (investors only)
- Must compete with other multi-units
- Lower price per SF

**Best For:**
- Quick flips
- Limited capital/time
- Markets where conversion doesn't add value
- Properties in OK but not great condition
- When you need liquidity quickly

**Target Numbers:**
- Sell at 1.2-1.5x purchase price
- ROI: 200-400% on down payment
- Total project time: 6-9 months

---

### Strategy 3: BRRRR (BUY, RENOVATE, RENT, REFINANCE, REPEAT)

**What It Is:**
Purchase property with low down payment, renovate, stabilize with tenants, refinance to pull out capital, hold long-term for cash flow and appreciation.

**Process:**
1. Purchase with low down payment (3-20%)
2. Renovate to market standard
3. Stabilize at market rents
4. Season for 6-12 months
5. Refinance at 75% LTV
6. Pull out most/all capital
7. Hold long-term

**Timeline:** 18-24 months to complete cycle

**Pros:**
- Infinite return potential (if you pull all capital)
- Build rental portfolio
- Long-term appreciation
- Tax benefits (depreciation)
- Hedge against inflation

**Cons:**
- Longest timeline (18-24 months)
- Landlord responsibilities
- Refinance risk (appraisal, rates)
- Cash flow typically modest (8-15% COC)
- Tenant management

**Best For:**
- Portfolio builders
- Long-term investors
- Good cash flow markets
- Purchased with significant equity
- Can get property to appraise 125%+ of all-in cost

**Target Numbers:**
- Cash-on-Cash Return: 10-18%
- Refinance pulls 80-100% of capital
- Hold for 5-10+ years
- Appreciation + cash flow = total return

---

### Strategy 4: HYBRID (SELL SOME, HOLD SOME)

**What It Is:**
Convert property to condos, sell 1-2 units for immediate profit, hold 1-2 units as long-term rentals.

**Process:**
1. Purchase property
2. Complete legal conversion
3. Renovate all units
4. Sell some units individually
5. Refinance remaining units
6. Hold as rentals long-term

**Timeline:** 12-15 months

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds
- Cash out most capital
- Keep rental income stream
- Lower risk than all-in conversion
- Hedge against market timing

**Cons:**
- Still requires conversion approval
- Complex to execute
- Some units may not sell immediately
- HOA/condo management for rentals

**Best For:**
- Conservative investors wanting both cash and cash flow
- Markets with strong owner-occupant demand
- Properties where some units are better than others
- Want to build portfolio while extracting capital

**Target Numbers:**
- ROI: 500-1,000% on down payment
- Cash returned: 150-300% of investment
- Retained rental income: 10-15% COC
- Total value created: Cash + Retained Equity

**Example:**
Triplex, purchase $600K, sell Units 2 & 3 for $400K each ($800K total), keep Unit 1 as rental worth $300K producing $30K/year. Total value: $800K cash + $300K asset = $1.1M value created from $600K purchase.

---

### Strategy 5: WHOLESALE (ASSIGNMENT)

**What It Is:**
Put property under contract, market it to other investors, assign contract for a fee.

**Process:**
1. Find off-market deal
2. Negotiate contract (with assignment clause)
3. Market to investor buyers
4. Assign contract for fee
5. Investor closes, you collect assignment fee

**Timeline:** 30-90 days

**Pros:**
- No money in deal (earnest money only)
- Fastest timeline (30-90 days)
- No renovation risk
- No holding costs
- No financing needed
- Build buyer relationships

**Cons:**
- Give up all conversion upside
- Need buyer network
- Seller may resist assignment
- Fee taxed as ordinary income
- Smaller profit ($10K-$50K typical)

**Best For:**
- New investors with limited capital

## 📊 KEY METRICS & BENCHMARKS

### Conversion Premium

**Target:** Individual units should sell for 15-30% more than property value as-is

**Formula:**
```
Conversion Premium = (Total Individual Sales - As-Is Value) ÷ As-Is Value

Example:
3 condos × $370,000 = $1,110,000
As-is triplex value = $825,000
Premium = ($1,110,000 - $825,000) ÷ $825,000 = 34.5% ✓
```

**Benchmarks:**
- **<15%:** Not worth effort/cost
- **15-25%:** Marginal, consider carefully
- **25-35%:** Good opportunity ✅
- **35-50%:** Excellent opportunity ✅
- **>50%:** Double-check comps (might be wrong)

## 🎓 CONVERSION STRATEGIES EXPLAINED

### CONDO CONVERSION

**What It Is:**
Transform a multi-unit property into a condominium where each unit can be individually owned and sold.

**Legal Process:**
1. File Declaration of Condominium with county
2. Create Condominium Association (HOA)
3. Record individual unit deeds
4. Establish CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions)
5. Separate utilities (if not already)
6. Get county approval

**Timeline:** 6-12 months

**Cost Range:**
- Duplex: $15K-$30K
- Triplex: $20K-$40K
- Quadplex: $25K-$50K
- 5-10 units: $50K-$100K+

**Best For:**
- Urban/suburban markets
- Strong owner-occupant demand
- Units similar in size/quality
- Good location
- Modern construction

**Pricing:**
Individual condos sell at 15-30% premium vs. property as-is

---

### TOWNHOME SUBDIVISION

**What It Is:**
Physically subdivide the lot into separate parcels, creating individual townhome properties with their own land.

**Legal Process:**
1. Survey property for lot line adjustment
2. File subdivision plat with county
3. Create separate legal descriptions
4. Establish shared area agreements (if needed)
5. Separate utilities
6. Get county approval

**Timeline:** 9-18 months (more complex)

**Cost Range:**
- Generally 50% higher than condo conversion
- Requires more extensive surveying
- May need infrastructure improvements

**Best For:**
- Suburban/rural areas
- Properties with adequate land
- Row houses or side-by-side units
- Buyers wanting land ownership
- Areas where condos stigmatized

**Pricing:**
Townhomes sell at 20-40% premium vs. multi-unit as-is

---

### CO-OP CONVERSION

**What It Is:**
Create a cooperative corporation where buyers purchase shares in the corporation, not the physical unit itself.

**Legal Process:**
1. Form cooperative corporation
2. Create proprietary leases for each unit
3. Establish board of directors
4. File with county
5. Issue shares
6. Sell shares (not real estate)

**Timeline:** 4-8 months (fastest)

**Cost Range:**
- Generally 40% less than condo conversion
- Simpler legal process
- Less common (harder to sell)

**Best For:**
- NYC and select urban markets
- Buildings with high-end units
- Sophisticated buyer pool
- Tax advantages for corporation

**Pricing:**
Co-ops sell at 10-20% premium vs. multi-unit (lower than condos)

---

### LEGAL SUBDIVISION (LOT SPLIT)

**What It Is:**
Physically divide the parcel into separate lots, each with its own building/unit.

**Legal Process:**
1. Survey and create subdivision plat
2. File lot split application
3. Ensure separate access for each lot
4. Separate utilities and infrastructure
5. Create new APNs (parcel numbers)
6. Get county approval

**Timeline:** 12-24 months (longest)

**Cost Range:**
- Most expensive option
- May require infrastructure improvements
- Street access, utilities, etc.
- $50K-$200K+ depending on scope

**Best For:**
- Large lots (can be physically divided)
- Detached units (not connected)
- Rural/suburban areas
- Buyers wanting maximum independence

**Pricing:**
Separate lots sell at 30-50% premium vs. multi-unit

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### 1. Not Checking Zoning BEFORE Buying

**Mistake:**
Buy property assuming condo conversion is allowed, find out after closing it's prohibited.

**Solution:**
- Call county planning department FIRST
- Ask: "Is condo conversion allowed at [address]?"
- Get answer in writing
- Make offer contingent on conversion approval

**Red Flags:**
- "Zoning doesn't permit"
- "HOA prohibits subdivisions"
- "Moratorium on conversions"
- "Previous conversion denied"

---

### 2. Underestimating Conversion Timeline

**Mistake:**
Assume 3-month conversion process, actually takes 12 months, blowing up your pro forma.

**Solution:**
- Add 3-6 months buffer to estimates
- Plan for worst-case timeline
- Have capital reserves for extended hold
- Consider selling as-is if delayed

**Reality:**
- County says: "6-9 months" → Plan for 12 months
- Attorney says: "4 months" → Plan for 6 months
- Always double timeline estimates

---

### 3. Not Getting Actual Contractor Bids

**Mistake:**
Estimate renovation at $15K per unit, reality is $30K per unit.

**Solution:**
- Walk property with 3 contractors
- Get detailed bids (not ballpark)
- Use HIGHEST bid (not average)
- Add 15-20% contingency
- Budget for unknowns (walls, foundation, etc.)

**Conservative Budgeting:**
```
Contractor A bid: $25,000
Contractor B bid: $28,000
Contractor C bid: $32,000

Use: $32,000 (highest)
Add contingency: $32,000 × 1.15 = $36,800
Budget: $36,800 per unit
```

---

### 4. Ignoring Legal/Conversion Costs

**Mistake:**
Focus only on purchase and renovation, forget $30K-$50K in legal fees.

**Solution:**
- Budget conversion costs early
- Get attorney quotes before closing
- Include in total project analysis
- Don't underestimate county fees

**Reality Check:**
```
Purchase: $600,000
Renovation: $60,000
Conversion: $35,000 ← Often forgotten!
Total: $695,000
```

---

### 5. Overpaying on Purchase

**Mistake:**
Fall in love with property, pay retail, then no exit strategy works.

**The Truth:**
If you buy at the right price, you have options:
- Subdivide for maximum profit
- Sell as-is for good profit
- Hold as rental for cash flow
- Wholesale for quick cash

If you overpay, NOTHING works.

**Target Purchase Price Formula:**
```
Individual Unit Sales × 70% - Renovation - Conversion = Max Offer

Example:

### 6. Not Having Adequate Reserves

**Mistake:**
Use all capital on down payment and renovation, run out of money during conversion hold period.

**Solution:**
- Budget 6-12 months of carry costs
- Include mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities
- Plan for timeline delays
- Have backup capital sources

**Reserve Formula:**
```
Monthly Carry Cost × 12 months = Minimum Reserve

Example:
Mortgage: $4,200
Taxes: $800
Insurance: $200
Utilities: $300
Total: $5,500/month

Reserve Needed: $5,500 × 12 = $66,000
```

### 7. Poor Market Timing

**Mistake:**
Start conversion in November, try to sell condos in February (worst time).

**Solution:**
- Plan to list units in spring (March-May)
- Or fall (September-October)
- Avoid winter months
- Consider market cycles
- Time renovation to finish before spring

**Best Selling Months:**
1. **April-May:** Peak market
2. **September-October:** Fall market
3. **June-August:** Summer buyers
4. **November-February:** Worst time

## 🎯 SUCCESS PRINCIPLES

### The 70% Rule (Modified for Multi-Unit)

**Formula:**
```
Maximum Purchase Price = (ARV × 70%) - Renovation - Conversion

Where:
ARV = After Repair Value (either as-is multi-unit OR sum of individual units)
```

**Example:**
```
Scenario: Triplex
Individual unit sales: 3 × $370K = $1,110,000
70% Rule: $1,110,000 × 0.70 = $777,000
Less renovation: $62,700
Less conversion: $34,650
Maximum offer: $679,650

Negotiate down to: $600K-$650K range
```

---

### The Conversion Premium Test

**Minimum Threshold:** 15% premium

**Formula:**
```
Premium % = (Individual Sales - As-Is Value) ÷ As-Is Value

If Premium < 15% → Don't convert, sell as-is
If Premium 15-25% → Marginal, analyze carefully
If Premium 25%+ → Strong conversion candidate
```

---

### The Timeline Buffer Rule

**Always double the estimates:**

```
County says: "6 months" → Budget 12 months
Attorney says: "90 days" → Budget 180 days
Contractor says: "2 months" → Budget 4 months
```

**Why?**
- Government delays
- Weather delays
- Contractor issues
- Inspection problems
- Document errors
- Market timing

---

### The Reserve Capital Rule

**Minimum:** 6 months of carry costs
**Better:** 12 months of carry costs

**Formula:**
```
Monthly Carry = Mortgage + Taxes + Insurance + Utilities + Maintenance

Reserve = Monthly Carry × 12 months

Example:
$4,200 + $800 + $200 + $300 + $500 = $6,000/month
Reserve needed: $6,000 × 12 = $72,000
```
