## 📊 KEY METRICS & TARGETS

### Conversion Premium Test
```
Premium = (Individual Unit Sales - As-Is Value) ÷ As-Is Value

✅ 25-35%: Good opportunity
✅ 35-50%: Excellent opportunity
❌ <15%: Don't convert, sell as-is
```

### The 70% Rule (Multi-Unit)
```
Max Purchase = (ARV × 70%) - Renovation - Conversion

Example:
3 units × $370K = $1,110,000
70% = $777,000
Less reno: $62,700
Less conversion: $34,650
MAX OFFER: $679,650
```

### Cost Per Unit Guidelines

**Renovation:**
- Light: $5K-$15K per unit
- Moderate: $15K-$30K per unit  
- Heavy: $30K-$50K+ per unit

**Conversion:**
- Duplex: $15K-$30K total
- Triplex: $20K-$40K total
- Quadplex: $25K-$50K total
- 5-10 units: $50K-$100K+ total

### Reserve Capital Formula
```
Reserve = Monthly Carry × 12 months

Monthly Carry = Mortgage + Taxes + Insurance + Utilities + Maintenance

Example: $6,000/month × 12 = $72,000 reserve
```
