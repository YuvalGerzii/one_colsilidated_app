## 🔍 QUICK COMPS CHECK

### Individual Condos (Target: $425K-$450K each):
```
Search: Zillow → North Miami Beach → Condos
Filter: 800-1,000 SF, 2BR, Sold last 6 months

Target $/SF: $475-$510
Your unit: 889 SF × $490 = $435,610
Round to: $430K-$450K ✅
```

### Duplexes (Target: $800K-$850K):
```
Search: Zillow → North Miami Beach → Multi-family
Filter: 2 units, 1,700-1,900 SF, Recently sold

Target: $830K-$850K (investor pricing)
Your duplex: 1,778 SF = $850K max ✅
```

**The Math:**
- Sell as duplex: $850K
- Sell as 2 condos: $900K
- **Extra profit:** $50K (worth the 6-month delay?)
