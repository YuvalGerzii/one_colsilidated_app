RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES - STUDY GUIDE
=====================================

DEFINITION
----------
Residential properties are real estate assets designed for people to live in, including apartments, houses, condos, townhouses, and multi-family buildings (duplexes, triplexes, and small apartment buildings).

KEY CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------
• Primary use: Housing for individuals and families
• Zoning: Designated for residential use
• Typical lease terms: 6-12 months for rentals
• High liquidity compared to commercial properties
• Larger buyer pool (both investors and owner-occupiers)
• Emotional factors influence pricing


INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
---------------------

1. Buy and Hold (Rental Income)
   - Purchase property and rent to tenants
   - Generate monthly cash flow
   - Build equity through mortgage paydown
   - Benefit from property appreciation

2. House Flipping
   - Buy undervalued properties
   - Renovate and improve
   - Sell quickly for profit
   - Requires market timing and renovation expertise

3. House Hacking
   - Live in one unit while renting others
   - Offset mortgage with rental income
   - Good strategy for first-time investors
   - Common in multi-family properties

4. BRRRR Method
   - Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat
   - Extract equity through refinancing
   - Recycle capital into next investment


KEY CALCULATIONS & METRICS
---------------------------

1. Gross Rental Yield
   Formula: (Annual Rental Income / Property Price) × 100
   Example: (₪60,000 / ₪1,500,000) × 100 = 4%
   Purpose: Quick assessment of rental return

2. Net Rental Yield
   Formula: [(Annual Rent - Annual Expenses) / Property Price] × 100
   Include: Property tax, insurance, maintenance, vacancy, management fees
   Purpose: More accurate return measurement

3. Cash-on-Cash Return
   Formula: (Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) × 100
   Purpose: Measures return on actual money invested (down payment + costs)

4. Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)
   Formula: (Net Operating Income / Property Value) × 100
   NOI = Rental Income - Operating Expenses (excluding mortgage)
   Purpose: Compare investment opportunities

5. Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
   Formula: Net Operating Income / Annual Debt Service
   Lenders typically require: DSCR ≥ 1.25
   Purpose: Measures ability to cover mortgage payments

6. 1% Rule (Quick Screening)
   Rule: Monthly rent should be ≥ 1% of purchase price
   Example: ₪1,500,000 property should rent for ≥ ₪15,000/month
   Purpose: Fast filter for potentially good investments

7. Break-Even Occupancy
   Formula: (Operating Expenses + Debt Service) / Gross Potential Income
   Purpose: Minimum occupancy needed to cover costs


EXPENSE CATEGORIES TO CONSIDER
-------------------------------
• Property Tax (Arnona in Israel)
• Insurance (building and contents)
• Maintenance and repairs (typically 1-2% of property value annually)
• Property management fees (8-10% of rental income)
• Vacancy allowance (5-10% of potential income)
• Utilities (if landlord-paid)
• HOA/Vaad Bayit fees
• Mortgage interest and principal


RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------
• Market Risk: Property values can decline
• Vacancy Risk: Periods without tenants = no income
• Tenant Risk: Problem tenants, damage, non-payment
• Liquidity Risk: Takes time to sell if you need cash
• Maintenance Costs: Unexpected repairs can be expensive
• Interest Rate Risk: Affects mortgage costs and property values
• Regulatory Risk: Rent control, tenant protection laws
• Location Sensitivity: Neighborhood changes affect values


VALUATION APPROACHES
---------------------

1. Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)
   - Compare with similar recently sold properties
   - Adjust for differences in size, condition, location
   - Most common for residential

2. Income Approach
   - Based on potential rental income
   - More relevant for investment properties
   - Value = NOI / Cap Rate

3. Cost Approach
   - Land value + Construction cost - Depreciation
   - Used for new construction or unique properties


DUE DILIGENCE CHECKLIST
------------------------
✓ Property inspection (structure, systems, roof, foundation)
✓ Title search and ownership verification
✓ Zoning compliance check
✓ Review rental history and tenant leases
✓ Assess neighborhood trends and development plans
✓ Calculate all potential returns and expenses
✓ Review building permits and code compliance
✓ Check for liens, encumbrances, or legal issues
✓ Evaluate comparable sales in the area
✓ Analyze local rental demand and vacancy rates


SUCCESS FACTORS
----------------
• Location: The most important factor - proximity to employment, schools, transport
• Condition: Well-maintained properties command higher rents and values
• Market Research: Understanding local supply/demand dynamics
• Financial Discipline: Proper budgeting for expenses and reserves
• Tenant Screening: Quality tenants reduce problems and vacancy
• Professional Network: Good contractors, property managers, agents
• Long-term Perspective: Residential real estate typically appreciates over time


COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
-------------------------
× Underestimating expenses and renovation costs
× Overleveraging with too much debt
× Ignoring due diligence to rush a deal
× Buying in declining neighborhoods
× Emotional decisions instead of financial analysis
× Inadequate cash reserves for emergencies
× Poor property management
× Confusing gross yield with actual returns
