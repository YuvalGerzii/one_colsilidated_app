INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES - STUDY GUIDE
====================================

DEFINITION
----------
Industrial properties are commercial real estate assets used for manufacturing, production, distribution, storage, and research & development. These properties range from small flex warehouses to massive distribution centers and specialized manufacturing facilities.

By Building Class:

• Class A: Modern (0-10 years), 30+ ft clear heights, excellent location, state-of-the-art
• Class B: Functional (10-25 years), 18-28 ft clear heights, good condition
• Class C: Older (25+ years), 16-20 ft clear heights, basic functionality
• Class D: Obsolete, minimal clear height, significant deferred maintenance


KEY CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------
• Location-driven: Highway access, proximity to ports/airports critical
• Long lease terms: 5-10 years typical, up to 20+ years
• Lower operating expenses: Tenant often pays most (NNN leases)
• Triple Net leases common: Tenant pays taxes, insurance, maintenance
• Large floor plates: Minimal interior walls, open space
• Functionality critical: Clear height, loading docks, power capacity
• Lower CapEx: Simple construction, minimal tenant improvements
• Industrial tenants: Credit quality varies widely
• E-commerce impact: Driving unprecedented demand


INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
---------------------

1. Core Industrial
   - Modern facilities, strong locations

   - E-commerce fulfillment
   - Near population centers
   - Premium rents
   - Limited supply in urban areas


KEY CALCULATIONS & METRICS
---------------------------

1. Net Operating Income (NOI)
   Formula: Effective Gross Income - Operating Expenses
   
   Note: Industrial typically has LOWER operating expenses than other property types
   
   Example:
   100,000 sq ft × ₪60/sq ft = ₪6,000,000 rent
   Operating expenses (10-20%) = ₪900,000
   NOI = ₪5,100,000

2. Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)
   Formula: (NOI / Property Value) × 100
   
   Typical ranges by type:
   • Warehouse/Distribution: 5-7%
   • Manufacturing: 7-9%
   • Flex Space: 6-8%
   • Cold Storage: 5-6% (specialized)
   • Data Centers: 5-7% (mission-critical)

3. Price Per Square Foot/Meter
   Formula: Total Price / Total Building Area
   
   Market comparison tool
   Varies widely by:
   • Location (port vs. inland)
   • Building specifications
   • Clear height
   • Number of dock doors

4. Dock Doors Per Square Foot
   Formula: Number of Dock Doors / Total Square Footage
   
   Industry standard: 1 door per 10,000-15,000 sq ft
   More doors = higher functionality = higher value

5. Clear Height Premium
   Measured from floor to lowest obstruction
   
   Value hierarchy:
   • 16-20 ft: Class C, obsolete
   • 20-24 ft: Class B, functional
   • 24-28 ft: Class B+, good
   • 28-32 ft: Class A, excellent
   • 32+ ft: Class A+, premium
   
   Each additional foot = higher storage capacity = rent premium

6. Land Coverage Ratio
   Formula: Building Footprint / Total Land Area
   
   Typical: 35-50% building coverage
   Remainder: Parking, truck courts, landscaping
   
   Efficiency measure for site utilization

7. Truck Court Depth
   Minimum: 120-130 feet for turning radius
   Purpose: Ensure 53-foot tractor-trailers can maneuver
   Critical for: Distribution facilities

8. Power Density (for specialized facilities)
   Measured in: Watts per square foot
   
   Standard warehouse: 10-20 watts/sq ft
   Light manufacturing: 30-50 watts/sq ft
   Data centers: 150-300+ watts/sq ft
   
   Higher power = higher operating costs but specialized uses

9. Operating Expense Ratio (OER)
   Formula: (Operating Expenses / Effective Gross Income) × 100
   
   Industrial typically LOWEST of all commercial:
   • NNN leases: 5-15% (most expenses pass through)
   • Modified Gross: 15-25%
   • Full Service: 25-35%

10. Tenant Improvements (TI) Per Square Foot
    Typical allowances:
    • Warehouse: ₪50-150/sq ft
    • Manufacturing: ₪150-400/sq ft (equipment-dependent)
    • Flex/Office: ₪200-500/sq ft
    • Cold storage: ₪500-1,000+/sq ft (specialized systems)

11. Lease Value Per Dock Door
    Formula: Annual Rent / Number of Dock Doors
    
    Purpose: Compare functionality and value
    Higher value per door = better pricing

12. Absorption Rate
    Formula: Net Square Feet Leased / Time Period
    
    Example: 500,000 sq ft absorbed in Q1 = strong market
    Critical for: Development timing decisions


INCOME & LEASE STRUCTURES
--------------------------

Primary Income:
• Base rent (typically annual, per sq ft/meter)
• Rent escalations (2-3% annually or CPI-based)
• Operating expense recoveries

Additional Income:
• Yard/outside storage fees
• Excess power charges
• Additional dock door fees
• Signage fees
• Antenna/telecom leases
• Parking lot rental

Common Lease Types:

1. Triple Net (NNN) - Most Common
   Tenant pays: Base rent + taxes + insurance + maintenance
   Landlord receives: Pure net income
   Landlord responsible for: Roof and structure only
   Best for: Investors seeking passive income

2. Modified Gross
   Landlord pays: Some operating expenses
   Tenant pays: Base rent + share of expenses
   Common in: Multi-tenant properties

3. Gross/Full Service
   Landlord pays: All operating expenses
   Rare in industrial
   Tenant pays: Only base rent


OPERATING EXPENSES
-------------------

Landlord Responsibilities (NNN):

VALUATION METHODS
------------------

1. Income Capitalization (Primary)
   Value = NOI / Cap Rate
   
   Example:
   100,000 sq ft × ₪60/sq ft = ₪6,000,000
   Operating expenses (15%) = ₪900,000
   NOI = ₪5,100,000
   Cap rate 6.5% = ₪78,461,538

2. Comparable Sales
   Price per square foot analysis
   Adjust for:
   • Clear height differences
   • Dock door count
   • Location/access
   • Age and condition
   • Tenant credit quality

3. Replacement Cost
   Land + Construction - Depreciation
   
   Construction costs (per sq ft):
   • Basic warehouse: ₪1,500-2,500/sq ft
   • Modern distribution: ₪2,500-4,000/sq ft
   • Cold storage: ₪5,000-8,000/sq ft
   • Data center: ₪8,000-15,000+/sq ft
