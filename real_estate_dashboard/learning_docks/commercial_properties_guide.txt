COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES - STUDY GUIDE
====================================

DEFINITION
----------
Commercial properties are real estate assets used primarily for business purposes, including office buildings, retail spaces, shopping centers, hotels, medical buildings, and warehouses used for business operations.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------
• Primary use: Business operations and commerce
• Tenants: Businesses, not individuals
• Lease terms: Typically 3-10+ years (longer than residential)
• Professional tenant relationships
• Triple Net (NNN) leases common
• Higher income potential but higher risk
• Valuation based primarily on income generation
• Requires larger capital investment


PROPERTY SUB-TYPES
------------------

1. Office Buildings
   - Class A: Premium, newest, best locations
   - Class B: Mid-range, functional, good condition
   - Class C: Older, basic amenities, lower rents

2. Retail Properties
   - Strip centers
   - Shopping malls
   - Standalone stores
   - Restaurant spaces

3. Medical Office Buildings (MOB)
   - Doctor offices
   - Dental clinics
   - Specialized medical facilities

4. Hospitality
   - Hotels
   - Motels
   - Resorts


INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
---------------------

1. Core Investing
   - High-quality properties in prime locations
   - Stabilized occupancy with creditworthy tenants
   - Lower returns (6-8%) but lower risk
   - Focus on income generation

2. Value-Add
   - Underperforming properties
   - Renovate, reposition, improve management
   - Moderate risk, moderate returns (10-15%)
   - Active management required

3. Opportunistic
   - Development or major repositioning
   - Distressed properties or foreclosures
   - High risk, high potential returns (15%+)
   - Requires expertise and capital reserves

4. Sale-Leaseback
   - Business sells property but continues leasing it
   - Provides liquidity while maintaining operations
   - Long-term tenant commitment typical


KEY CALCULATIONS & METRICS
---------------------------

1. Net Operating Income (NOI)
   Formula: Gross Income - Operating Expenses
   Excludes: Mortgage payments, depreciation, taxes
   Critical: Most important metric in commercial real estate

2. Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)
   Formula: (NOI / Property Value) × 100
   Example: ₪500,000 NOI / ₪10,000,000 = 5% cap rate
   Purpose: Primary valuation metric
   Note: Lower cap rate = higher price, typically safer investment

3. Cash-on-Cash Return
   Formula: (Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) × 100
   Includes: Mortgage payments in calculation
   Purpose: Actual return on invested capital

4. Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
   Formula: NOI / Annual Debt Service
   Lenders typically require: DSCR ≥ 1.20-1.30
   Example: ₪500,000 NOI / ₪350,000 debt = 1.43 DSCR
   Purpose: Loan qualification and risk assessment

5. Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)
   Formula: Property Price / Gross Annual Rent
   Example: ₪10,000,000 / ₪800,000 = 12.5 GRM
   Purpose: Quick comparison tool

6. Operating Expense Ratio (OER)
   Formula: (Operating Expenses / Gross Operating Income) × 100
   Typical range: 35-50% for commercial properties
   Purpose: Efficiency measurement

7. Price Per Square Meter
   Formula: Property Price / Total Leasable Area
   Purpose: Market comparison and valuation

8. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
   Complex calculation including all cash flows over time
   Accounts for: Time value of money
   Purpose: Long-term investment performance
   Typical targets: 12-20% depending on strategy

9. Break-Even Occupancy Rate
   Formula: (Operating Expenses + Debt Service) / Gross Potential Rent
   Purpose: Minimum occupancy to cover costs


LEASE STRUCTURES
-----------------

1. Gross Lease (Full Service)
   - Landlord pays all operating expenses
   - Tenant pays only base rent
   - Common in: Class A office buildings

2. Modified Gross Lease
   - Expenses shared between landlord and tenant
   - Variations exist based on negotiation
   - Common in: Multi-tenant buildings

3. Triple Net Lease (NNN)
   - Tenant pays: Base rent + property taxes + insurance + maintenance
   - Landlord receives predictable net income
   - Common in: Single-tenant retail, corporate locations
   - Most favorable for investors

4. Percentage Lease
   - Base rent + percentage of tenant's gross sales
   - Common in: Retail, especially malls
   - Landlord benefits from tenant success


EXPENSE CATEGORIES
-------------------
• Property taxes (Arnona)
• Building insurance
• Common area maintenance (CAM)
• Property management (3-6% of gross income)
• Repairs and maintenance
• Utilities (if landlord-paid)
• Security services
• Janitorial services
• Landscaping and exterior maintenance
• Elevator maintenance
• HVAC system maintenance
• Marketing and leasing commissions
• Legal and accounting fees
• Capital reserves (1-3% of property value)


VALUATION METHODS
------------------

1. Income Capitalization Approach (Primary Method)
   Formula: Property Value = NOI / Cap Rate
   Example: ₪500,000 NOI / 5% cap = ₪10,000,000 value
   Most common for stabilized properties

2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
   - Projects future cash flows
   - Discounts to present value
   - Includes terminal value (resale)
   - Best for: Value-add and development projects

3. Sales Comparison Approach
   - Compare with similar recent sales
   - Adjust for differences
   - Used as: Secondary validation method

4. Cost Approach
   - Land value + Replacement cost - Depreciation
   - Used for: New construction, special-use properties


TENANT CREDIT ANALYSIS
-----------------------
• Financial statements review
• Credit scores and payment history
• Business stability and industry trends
• Personal guarantees (for smaller tenants)
• Security deposits (typically 3-6 months rent)
• Letter of credit requirements
• Corporate vs. franchise operations


RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------
• Tenant Concentration: Loss of major tenant is significant
• Market Risk: Economic downturns affect businesses first
• Lease Rollover Risk: Vacancy during lease renewal periods
• Capital Expenditure: Major systems replacement costs
• Obsolescence: Technology and design changes
• Location Dependency: Business district changes
• Longer Marketing Times: Fewer potential tenants than residential
• Economic Sensitivity: Directly tied to business cycles
• Regulatory Changes: Zoning, building codes, ADA compliance


DUE DILIGENCE CHECKLIST
------------------------
✓ Review rent roll (all tenant leases, terms, rates)
✓ Analyze 3+ years of operating statements
✓ Verify tenant credit quality and payment history
✓ Inspect property condition and deferred maintenance
✓ Review all lease agreements and renewal options
✓ Environmental assessments (Phase I, possibly Phase II)
✓ Title search and survey
✓ Zoning compliance and permitted uses
✓ Review service contracts (HVAC, security, janitorial)
✓ Assess local market conditions and competition
✓ Verify actual vs. pro forma financials
✓ Check for pending litigation
✓ Review capital expenditure needs (roof, HVAC, parking)
✓ Analyze traffic patterns and accessibility
✓ Verify utility capacity and costs


KEY SUCCESS FACTORS
--------------------
• Location: Access, visibility, parking, demographics
• Tenant Quality: Creditworthy, stable businesses
• Lease Terms: Long-term leases reduce vacancy risk
• Professional Management: Critical for operations
• Market Knowledge: Understanding local supply/demand
• Relationship Building: With tenants and brokers
• Capital Reserves: For unexpected expenses
• Diversification: Multiple tenants reduce risk


CAP RATE CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------
Lower Cap Rates (4-6%):
• Prime locations
• Class A properties
• Strong, creditworthy tenants
• Lower perceived risk
• Higher purchase prices

Higher Cap Rates (8-12%):
• Secondary/tertiary markets
• Class B/C properties
• Higher vacancy or tenant risk
• Value-add opportunities
• Lower purchase prices


COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
-------------------------
× Overestimating rental income potential
× Underestimating operating expenses
× Ignoring tenant credit quality
× Failing to budget for capital expenditures
× Relying solely on pro forma financials
× Inadequate reserve funds
× Poor lease documentation
× Neglecting property condition assessments
× Overpaying in competitive markets
× Insufficient market research
× Lack of exit strategy planning


MARKET ANALYSIS FACTORS
------------------------
• Employment rates and job growth
• Population trends
• Income levels and demographics
• Competing properties (supply)
• Absorption rates (demand)
• New construction pipeline
• Transportation infrastructure
• Economic development plans
• Industry concentration
• Retail spending patterns (for retail properties)
