MULTI-FAMILY PROPERTIES (APARTMENT BUILDINGS) - STUDY GUIDE
============================================================

DEFINITION
----------
Multi-family properties are residential buildings containing multiple separate housing units, ranging from small duplexes to large apartment complexes. These properties are designed for multiple families or individuals to live independently within the same structure.

PROPERTY CLASSIFICATIONS
-------------------------

By Size:
• Small Multi-Family: 2-4 units (duplex, triplex, fourplex)
• Mid-Size: 5-49 units
• Large: 50-200 units
• Institutional: 200+ units

By Class (Quality/Age):
• Class A: Luxury, newest (0-10 years), premium amenities, top locations
• Class B: Mid-range, good condition (10-25 years), standard amenities
• Class C: Older (25+ years), basic amenities, lower-income tenants
• Class D: Very old, significant deferred maintenance, distressed


KEY CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------
• Economies of scale: Lower per-unit operating costs
• Diversified income: Multiple rent streams reduce risk
• Professional operation: Requires property management
• Commercial financing: 5+ units treated as commercial
• Higher barriers to entry: Larger capital requirements
• More stable than single-family: Less vacancy impact
• Tenant turnover: Higher than single-family but predictable
• Value based on income: Not comparable sales


INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
---------------------

1. Value-Add Strategy
   - Buy underperforming properties
   - Renovate units and common areas
   - Improve management and reduce expenses
   - Increase rents to market rates
   - Refinance or sell at higher value
   Target Returns: 15-20% IRR

2. Core/Stabilized Strategy
   - Buy well-maintained, fully occupied properties
   - Focus on steady cash flow
   - Minimal capital improvements needed
   - Long-term hold strategy
   - Lower risk, lower returns
   Target Returns: 8-12% IRR

3. Opportunistic/Development
   - Ground-up construction
   - Major repositioning
   - Distressed properties
   - Highest risk and returns
   Target Returns: 20%+ IRR

4. BRRRR at Scale
   - Buy distressed multi-family
   - Renovate units systematically
   - Rent at market rates
   - Refinance based on increased NOI
   - Repeat process with equity


KEY CALCULATIONS & METRICS
---------------------------

1. Net Operating Income (NOI)
   Formula: Effective Gross Income - Operating Expenses
   
   Effective Gross Income = 
   (Gross Potential Rent × Occupancy Rate) + Other Income
   
   Example:
   50 units × ₪4,000/month × 12 = ₪2,400,000 potential
   95% occupancy = ₪2,280,000
   + Other income ₪120,000 = ₪2,400,000 EGI
   - Operating expenses ₪1,200,000
   = ₪1,200,000 NOI

2. Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)
   Formula: (NOI / Property Value) × 100
   Example: ₪1,200,000 / ₪16,000,000 = 7.5%
   
   Also used for valuation:
   Property Value = NOI / Cap Rate
   ₪1,200,000 / 0.075 = ₪16,000,000

3. Cash-on-Cash Return
   Formula: (Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) × 100
   
   Example:
   NOI: ₪1,200,000
   - Debt Service: ₪800,000
   = Cash Flow: ₪400,000
   
   Cash Invested: ₪4,000,000 (25% down + closing)
   Return: ₪400,000 / ₪4,000,000 = 10%

4. Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
   Formula: NOI / Annual Debt Service
   Example: ₪1,200,000 / ₪800,000 = 1.5
   
   Lenders typically require:
   • Stabilized properties: DSCR ≥ 1.25
   • Value-add properties: DSCR ≥ 1.35

5. Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)
   Formula: Property Price / Gross Annual Rent
   Example: ₪16,000,000 / ₪2,400,000 = 6.67
   Purpose: Quick screening and market comparison

6. Price Per Unit
   Formula: Total Property Price / Number of Units
   Example: ₪16,000,000 / 50 units = ₪320,000 per unit
   Purpose: Market comparison tool

7. Operating Expense Ratio (OER)
   Formula: (Operating Expenses / Effective Gross Income) × 100
   Example: ₪1,200,000 / ₪2,400,000 = 50%
   
   Typical ranges:
   • Class A: 35-40%
   • Class B: 40-50%
   • Class C: 50-60%

8. Break-Even Occupancy
   Formula: (Operating Expenses + Debt Service) / Gross Potential Income
   Example: (₪1,200,000 + ₪800,000) / ₪2,400,000 = 83.3%
   Purpose: Minimum occupancy to cover all costs

9. Economic Occupancy Rate
   Formula: (Collected Rent / Potential Rent) × 100
   Accounts for: Physical vacancy + loss to lease + bad debt
   More accurate than physical occupancy alone

10. Return on Investment (ROI) - Full Cycle
    Formula: [(Sale Price - Purchase Price - Capex) / Total Investment] × 100
    Includes: Appreciation and forced appreciation

11. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
    Time-weighted return considering:
    • All cash flows (positive and negative)
    • Timing of cash flows
    • Terminal value (sale proceeds)
    • Typically projected over 5-10 year hold period

VALUATION METHODS
------------------

1. Income Capitalization (Primary)
   Value = NOI / Market Cap Rate
   
   Steps:
   a) Calculate stabilized NOI
   b) Research comparable cap rates
   c) Apply cap rate to determine value
   
   Example:
   NOI: ₪1,200,000
   Market Cap Rate: 6.5%
   Value: ₪1,200,000 / 0.065 = ₪18,461,538

2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
   Projects 5-10 year cash flows
   Includes:
   • Annual NOI growth
   • Capital expenditures
   • Terminal value (sale)
   • Discount rate (target return)
   
   Most sophisticated valuation method
   Used for: Value-add and repositioning

3. Comparable Sales Approach
   Compare with similar properties:
   • Price per unit
   • Price per square meter
   • Cap rates
   • GRM
   
   Adjust for differences in:
   • Location
   • Age and condition
   • Amenities
   • Unit mix

4. Replacement Cost
   Land Value + Construction Cost - Depreciation
   Used for: New construction feasibility
