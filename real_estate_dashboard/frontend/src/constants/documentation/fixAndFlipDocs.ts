## 🎯 THE 70% RULE (Core Formula)

\`\`\`
Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO) = (ARV × 70%) - Repair Costs
\`\`\`

**Example:**
- ARV: $300,000
- Repairs: $50,000
- **MAO = $160,000** ← Don't pay more than this!

### ROI (Return on Investment)
\`\`\`
ROI = Gross Profit / Cash Invested
\`\`\`
**Target:** 20%+ (adjust by market)

### Profit Margin
\`\`\`
Profit Margin = Gross Profit / ARV

**Target:** 15%+ of ARV

### All-In Cost
\`\`\`
All-In = Purchase + Closing + Reno + Holding + Finance Costs
\`\`\`

### Gross Profit
\`\`\`
Gross Profit = ARV - Selling Costs - All-In Cost
\`\`\`
