## 🚀 Getting Started (30 Minutes)

### Quick Start Process:

#### Step 1: Organize Files (5 min)
Create a deal folder with all five files:
```
Deal_Name/
├── DCF_Model_Comprehensive.xlsx
├── LBO_Model_Comprehensive.xlsx
├── Merger_Model_Comprehensive.xlsx
├── DD_Tracker_Comprehensive.xlsx
└── Integrated_Models_Dashboard.xlsx ← NEW!
```

#### Step 2: Open All Files (2 min)
Open all five Excel files simultaneously so Excel can track the relationships.

#### Step 3: Review Dashboard (5 min)
- Open Integrated_Models_Dashboard.xlsx
- Read the Integration Instructions sheet
- Review each of the 4 main sheets
- Understand the structure

#### Step 4: Test Sample Link (5 min)
Create one external link to verify the process works:
1. In Master Dashboard cell B11
2. Type: `='[DCF_Model_Comprehensive.xlsx]Valuation'!B25`
3. Adjust sheet name and cell as needed for your actual files
4. Verify value appears (not #REF!)

#### Step 5: Begin Entry (10 min)
- Enter deal information in each model
- Use same values to establish baseline
- Review how Dashboard would pull these values

#### Step 6: Plan Linking (3 min)
- Review INTEGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- Note which cells to link
- Schedule time to create all links

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start Simple
Don't try to link everything on Day 1. Start with the most important metrics and add more links over time.

### 2. Use Named Ranges
In your individual models, create named ranges for key outputs. This makes linking easier and more reliable.

### 3. Version Control
Always save a new version before major changes. Use date stamps in filenames.

### 4. Team Alignment
Schedule a team meeting to review the dashboard and agree on the workflow before your next deal.

### 5. Test First
Practice the full workflow on a completed deal before using in a live transaction.

### 6. Document Everything
Use cell comments to document data sources and assumptions. Your future self will thank you.

### 7. Regular Validation
Review the Cross-Model Validation sheet daily during active deals. Catch issues early.

### 8. Scenario Discipline
Always model at least 3 scenarios. Single-point estimates are dangerous.

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't:
- Make assumptions in one model without updating others
- Skip the DD integration step
- Present only Base Case without scenarios
- Ignore red flags in Cross-Model Validation
- Wait until IC week to build the dashboard
- Keep models in different folders
- Forget to save all files together

### ✅ Do:
- Update all models simultaneously with same data
- Quantify every material DD finding
- Always show Base/Bear/Bull scenarios
- Fix validation issues immediately
- Build dashboard as deal progresses
- Keep all files in same location
- Save frequently and together
