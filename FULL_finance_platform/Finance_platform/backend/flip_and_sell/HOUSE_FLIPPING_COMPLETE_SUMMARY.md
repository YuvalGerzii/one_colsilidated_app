## 🆕 SHEET 5: PROFORMA (MONTHLY CASH FLOW) (NEW!)

### What It Does
**Month-by-month cash flow tracking** from acquisition through sale

### Timeline Breakdown

| Month | Phase | Cash Out | Cash In | Net Cash Flow | Notes |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| **0** | **Acquisition** | Purchase + closing | $0 | Negative | Initial investment |
| **1** | **Renovation** | 1/3 reno + holding | $0 | Negative | Month 1 work |
| **2** | **Renovation** | 1/3 reno + holding | $0 | Negative | Month 2 work |
| **3** | **Renovation** | 1/3 reno + holding | $0 | Negative | Month 3 complete |
| **4** | **Marketing** | Staging + holding | $0 | Negative | List property |
| **5** | **Marketing** | Holding costs only | $0 | Negative | Under contract |
| **6** | **SALE** | Selling costs | ARV | **POSITIVE** | Cash in! |

### Key Metrics Calculated
1. **Total Cash Out:** All expenses across 6 months
2. **Total Cash In:** Sale proceeds
3. **Net Profit:** Total in - total out
4. **Maximum Capital Required:** Peak negative cash position
5. **Months to Break Even:** When cumulative becomes positive
6. **Annualized Return:** ROI adjusted for 6-month timeline

### Cost Breakdown by Phase
- **Acquisition:** Purchase price + closing costs
- **Renovation:** Total reno / 3 months + holding costs each month
- **Marketing:** Staging + photos + holding costs
- **Sale:** Commission (6%) + closing (1.5%) + staging

### Cumulative Tracking
The **Cumulative** column shows your running total:
- Starts deeply negative (after purchase)
- Gets more negative during renovation
- Becomes positive at sale
- Final number = your net profit

### How to Use
1. Timeline auto-populates from **Inputs** sheet
2. Renovation cost divides over 3 months
3. Holding costs calculate monthly based on Inputs
4. Sale happens at ARV from Inputs
5. Watch **Maximum Capital Required** = peak funding needed

### Pro Tips
- This shows your true capital needs
- Peak negative cash = how much you need available
- Longer holds = more holding costs
- Consider financing to reduce capital requirements

## 🆕 SHEET 6: FINANCING COMPARISON (NEW!)

### What It Does
**Side-by-side comparison** of 4 financing strategies

### The 4 Strategies Compared

#### Strategy 1: **ALL CASH**
**How it works:** Pay for everything with your own money

**Pros:**
- Highest ROI (no interest costs)
- Simple & clean exit
- No loan fees or points
- Fastest close

**Cons:**
- Ties up all your capital
- Limits deal flow
- Opportunity cost
- Can't scale easily

**Best for:**

- No income verification
- Based on property value
- Enables leverage

**Cons:**
- High interest rate (10%+)

- Short-term only (6-12 months)
- Expensive if deal drags

**Best for:**
- Limited capital
- Need fast closing
- Credit issues
- Experienced flippers

**Example Costs (on $200k project):**
- Loan Amount: $150,000 (75% LTC)
- Points (3%): $4,500 upfront
- Interest (6 months at 10%): $7,500

#### Strategy 3: **PRIVATE MONEY**

**Pros:**
- Lower rates than hard money

**Cons:**
- Requires network
- Takes time to arrange
- May be limited funds
- Personal liability

**Best for:**

- Can wait for funding
- Building portfolio

**Example Costs (on $200k project):**
- Loan Amount: $140,000 (70% LTC)
- Points: $0 (usually)
- Interest (6 months at 8%): $5,600
- Total Cost: $5,600

#### Strategy 4: **BRRRR** (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat)
**How it works:** Refi at 75% ARV after renovation, keep as rental

**Pros:**
- Keep the property
- Pull out most capital
- Monthly cash flow

- Cash Back: $17,500
- Plus: Monthly rent income
- Result: Recoup most money + keep property

### Comparison Table in Model

| Metric | All Cash | Hard Money | Private Money | BRRRR |
|--------|----------|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Loan Amount** | $0 | $150k (75%) | $140k (70%) | $218k (75% ARV) |
| **Cash Required** | $200k | $50k | $60k | $50k |
| **Financing Cost** | $0 | $12k | $5.6k | $8k |

| **ROI** | 29% | 92% | 87% | Cash flow |
| **Time to Exit** | 6 mo | 6 mo | 6 mo | Keep it |

### Automatic Recommendation
The model **automatically recommends the best strategy** based on:
- Highest ROI
- Your capital constraints
- Project timeline
- Risk tolerance

### How to Use
1. Model auto-calculates all 4 scenarios
2. Compare ROI, cash required, and total profit
3. Read pros/cons for each
4. Check recommendation at bottom
5. Choose based on your goals

### Pro Tips
- All cash = highest profit per deal, but slowest scaling
- Hard money = fast & flexible, but expensive
- Private money = best of both worlds if you have network
- BRRRR = build wealth, but more work

## 🆕 SHEET 7: SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS (NEW!)

### What It Does
**Tests your deal under 3 scenarios:** Best Case, Base Case, Worst Case

### The 3 Scenarios

#### **WORST CASE** (Murphy's Law: Everything goes wrong)
**Assumptions:**
- ARV drops 10% (market softens)
- Renovation costs 20% over budget
- Takes 9 months to sell (50% longer)
- Purchase price stays same (already bought)

**What It Shows:**
- Can you still make money?
- What's your downside risk?
- How bad can it get?

#### **BASE CASE** (Your Current Assumptions)
- ARV = your estimate from comps
- Renovation = your budget + 10% contingency
- Timeline = 6 months (your projection)
- This is your "expected" scenario

#### **BEST CASE** (Everything goes right)
**Assumptions:**
- ARV rises 5% (hot market!)
- Renovation 5% under budget
- Sells in 4 months (fast!)
- Purchase price same

**What It Shows:**
- What's your upside potential?
- Best you can hope for
- Reward for perfect execution

### Key Outputs Compared

| Metric | Worst Case | Base Case | Best Case |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **All-In Cost** | $228k (+9%) | $209k | $195k (-7%) |
| **Gross Profit** | $28k (-52%) | $58k | $75k (+29%) |
| **ROI** | 12% (-17 pts) | 28% | 38% (+10 pts) |
| **Profit Margin** | 11% | 20% | 26% |

### Risk Assessment Checks

**Can you afford worst case?**
- ✅ YES if profit > $0
- ❌ NO if you'd lose money

**Meets minimum profit target?**
- ✅ YES if worst case > your minimum
- ❌ NO if below threshold

**Deal quality in worst case?**
- ✅ ACCEPTABLE if ROI ≥ 15%
- ⚠️ MARGINAL if ROI = 10-15%
- ❌ RISKY if ROI < 10%

### Breakeven Analysis

**Breakeven ARV:** $241,000
- ARV can drop $49k (17%) before losing money
- This is your margin of safety

**Max Renovation Overrun:** $73,000
- Budget can increase 62% before unprofitable
- Contingency buffer is adequate

**Renovation Safety Margin:** 42%
- Budget has significant cushion
- Can handle major surprises

### How to Interpret

**Strong Deal:**
- Worst case still profitable
- >15% margin of safety on ARV
- ROI ≥ 15% in all scenarios

**Acceptable Deal:**
- Worst case slightly profitable
- 10-15% margin of safety
- ROI ≥ 10% in worst case

**Risky Deal:**
- Worst case = loss or break-even
- <10% margin of safety
- High downside, limited upside

### How to Use
1. Model auto-calculates all 3 scenarios
2. Review the comparison table
3. Check risk assessment answers
4. Verify breakeven numbers
5. Read overall assessment recommendation

### Decision Matrix

**PROCEED if:**
- ✅ Worst case is profitable
- ✅ Margin of safety > 15%
- ✅ Meets your minimum ROI

**BE CAUTIOUS if:**
- ⚠️ Worst case ROI < 10%
- ⚠️ Thin margins (< 10%)
- ⚠️ Large gap between best/worst

**WALK AWAY if:**
- ❌ Worst case = loss
- ❌ No margin of safety
- ❌ All scenarios below minimum

### Pro Tips
- Always underwrite to worst case
- If worst case is acceptable, do the deal
- Market timing matters - adjust ARV % accordingly
- Renovation contingency should be 10-20%
- Longer holds kill profits - be realistic
