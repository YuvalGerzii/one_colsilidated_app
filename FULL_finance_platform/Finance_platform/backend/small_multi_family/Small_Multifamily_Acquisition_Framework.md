## 4. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Step-by-Step Analysis Process

#### STEP 1: Validate Rent Roll
- **Obtain:** Trailing 12-month rent roll (T-12)
- **Check:** Unit-by-unit current rent vs. market rent
- **Identify:** Vacant units, upcoming lease expirations, below-market leases

**518 East 83rd Rent Roll Analysis:**
- **19 occupied units** (95% occupancy)
- **2 vacant units** (1C and 3A) - opportunity!
- **1 rent-stabilized unit** (1D at $834/month) - loss-to-lease
- **Average in-place rent:** $2,756/month
- **Average market rent:** $3,449/month
- **Mark-to-market upside:** 25%

#### STEP 2: Analyze Operating Expenses
- **Obtain:** Trailing 12-month P&L, tax bills, utility bills
- **Benchmark:** Compare to industry standards ($/unit or % of revenue)
- **Adjust:** Normalize for owner-unusual items, deferred maintenance

**518 East 83rd Operating Expenses:**

| Category | Annual Amount | $/Unit/Year | % of EGI | Industry Benchmark |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Property Taxes** | $128,935 | $6,447 | 18.8% | 15-25% (NYC high tax) |
| **Insurance** | $12,065 | $603 | 1.8% | 1-3% |
| **Utilities** | $36,900 | $1,845 | 5.4% | 5-10% (depends on bill-back) |
| **R&M** | $21,860 | $1,093 | 3.2% | 5-10% (low - deferred?) |
| **Management** | $14,470 | $724 | 2.1% | 4-6% (appears low) |
| **CapEx Reserve** | $10,000 | $500 | 1.5% | $300-$500/unit |
| **TOTAL** | $224,230 | $11,212 | 32.8% | 35-45% (efficient) |

**Key Observations:**
- Property taxes are high (NYC typical)
- R&M is low - likely deferred maintenance
- Management fee is low - owner-managed?
- Should add $500/unit CapEx reserve
- Overall efficient at 32.8% of EGI (target: <40%)

#### STEP 3: Underwrite Pro Forma
- **Revenue:** Apply market rents to vacant/below-market units
- **Expenses:** Normalize and add reserves
- **Growth:** Apply realistic rent and expense growth rates
- **NOI:** Calculate stabilized net operating income

**518 East 83rd Pro Forma:**

**Year 1 Stabilized (After Renovations):**
- Gross Rental Income: $689,650 (market rents)
- Vacancy Loss (5%): -$34,483
- Other Income: $8,351
- **Effective Gross Income:** $663,518

- Operating Expenses: $224,230 (normalized)
- **Net Operating Income:** $439,288

**Proforma vs. In-Place:**
- Current NOI: $419,978
- Proforma NOI: $439,288
- **Upside:** $19,310/year (4.6% NOI growth)

#### STEP 4: Calculate Returns
- **Acquisition Cost:** Purchase price + closing costs + immediate CapEx
- **Financing:** Determine loan amount, rate, amortization
- **Cash Flow:** NOI - Debt Service = Cash Flow Before Tax
- **Exit:** Model sale at exit cap rate in Year 5
- **Returns:** Calculate IRR, equity multiple, cash-on-cash

**518 East 83rd Returns (65% LTV, 6.5% Rate, 5-Year Hold):**

| Metric | Value | Benchmark | Grade |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Purchase Price** | $8,200,000 | $410K/unit | ✅ Reasonable |
| **Total Acquisition Cost** | $8,405,000 | Including closing | ✅ |
| **Loan Amount (65% LTV)** | $5,330,000 | 65% of purchase | ✅ |
| **Equity Required** | $3,075,000 | 35% down | ✅ |
| **Year 1 NOI** | $439,288 | Stabilized | ✅ |
| **Year 1 Debt Service** | -$428,520 | 30-year amort | ⚠️ Tight |
| **Year 1 Cash Flow** | $10,768 | After debt | ⚠️ Low |
| **Cash-on-Cash (Yr 1)** | 0.4% | Very low | ❌ Poor |
| **Exit Cap Rate (Yr 5)** | 5.5% | Assume stable | ✅ |
| **Exit Value (Yr 5)** | $9,560,000 | Based on Yr 5 NOI | ✅ |
| **Net Proceeds (Yr 5)** | $3,650,000 | After loan paydown | ✅ |
| **5-Year IRR (Levered)** | 3.5% | Low returns | ❌ Weak |
| **Equity Multiple** | 1.19x | Modest gain | ⚠️ Mediocre |

**VERDICT: PASS at $8.2M asking price**

**STEP 3: Enter Current Financials**
1. In-place gross rental income (from rent roll)
2. Vacancy rate (trailing 12-month actual)
3. Other income (laundry, parking, etc.)
4. Operating expenses (from T-12 P&L)
5. Calculate in-place NOI

**STEP 4: Enter Proforma Assumptions**
1. Proforma NOI (stabilized, at market rents)
2. Annual rent growth (2-4% typical)
3. Annual expense growth (2-4% typical)
4. Stabilized vacancy (5% conservative)
5. CapEx reserve ($300-$500/unit/year)

**STEP 5: Enter Financing Terms**
1. Loan-to-value (LTV) - typically 65-75%
2. Interest rate - current market rate
3. Amortization period (25-30 years typical)
4. Model calculates loan amount and debt service

**STEP 6: Enter Exit Assumptions**
1. Hold period (typically 5 years)

3. Selling costs (6% typical)

**STEP 7: Review Results**
1. **Executive Summary:** View key metrics
   - Price per unit, price per SF
   - In-place and proforma cap rates
   - Year 1 cash-on-cash return
2. **ProForma:** Review 10-year projections
   - Revenue growth
   - Expense growth
   - NOI trajectory
   - Cash flow before tax
3. **Investment Summary:**
   - Total equity required
   - Annual cash flows
   - Exit value and proceeds
   - IRR and equity multiple

**STEP 8: Run Sensitivity Analysis (Sensitivity Sheet)**
1. Test different exit cap rates
2. Test different purchase prices
3. Identify breakeven assumptions
4. Understand risk/return tradeoffs

### Model Customization Tips

**To Model a Different Property:**
1. Start with **Inputs** sheet
2. Change all BLUE cells to match your property
3. Update **Unit Mix** sheet with your actual unit data
4. Review formulas - they should all work automatically
5. Use **Sensitivity** sheet to test scenarios

**To Add More Detail:**
1. **Expense Detail:** Break out utilities into gas/electric/water
2. **Unit-Level Pro Forma:** Model each unit's rent trajectory
3. **Capital Plan:** Add detailed CapEx schedule by year
4. **Financing Detail:** Model multiple loans or mezz debt

**Common Modifications:**
- Add mezzanine debt (between senior and equity)
- Model value-add costs and rent increases by unit
- Add disposition scenarios (sell all, refi, hold longer)
- Include tax benefits (depreciation, 1031 exchange)

## 11. INTEGRATION WITH PORTFOLIO DASHBOARD

### Linking to Portfolio Dashboard Database

**For integration with the Portfolio Dashboard project, this model feeds data into:**

**1. Portfolio Companies Table**
- Company name = Property name
- Investment date = Acquisition closing date
- Investment amount = Equity invested
- Industry = Real Estate / Multifamily
- Status = Active

**2. Financial Metrics Table**
- Revenue = Gross rental income
- EBITDA = Net operating income (NOI)
- Net income = Cash flow after debt service
- Key ratios:
  - Cap rate (NOI / Purchase Price)
  - DSCR (NOI / Debt Service)
  - Debt / Equity ratio

**3. Valuation Table**
- Enterprise value = Property value
- Equity value = Property value - Loan balance
- Valuation multiples:
  - Price / NOI (inverse of cap rate)
  - Price per unit
  - Price per SF

**4. Cash Flow Table**
- Operating cash flow = Cash flow before tax
- Capital expenditures = CapEx reserve + improvements
- Distributions = Cash distributions to equity holders
- Cumulative invested capital = Equity + funded CapEx

### Automated PDF Data Extraction

**For properties with offering memorandums like 518 East 83rd:**

The Portfolio Dashboard's **PDF extraction pipeline** (`pdf_extraction_pipeline.py`) can automatically extract:

1. **Property Information:**
   - Address, units, SF, year built
   - Building class, zoning

2. **Financial Data:**
   - Offering price
   - Gross rent (in-place and proforma)
   - Operating expenses by category
   - NOI and cap rate

3. **Unit Mix:**
   - Unit-by-unit rent roll
   - Beds/baths, SF per unit
   - Lease expiration dates

4. **Comparable Properties:**
   - Recent sales comps
   - Rent comps
   - Cap rate comps

### API Integration Points

**For programmatic analysis of multiple properties:**

```python
# Example: Automated property analysis
from api_model_generator import generate_small_multifamily_model

# Input from PDF extraction or web scraping
property_data = {
    "address": "518 East 83rd Street",
    "units": 20,
    "sf": 8120,
    "purchase_price": 8200000,
