## 📊 RULE-OF-THUMB CALCULATIONS

### Quick Cash Flow Estimate
```
Gross Monthly Rent                    $2,450
× 95% (Occupancy)                     × 0.95
= Effective Gross Income              $2,328
- 50% (Operating Expenses)            - $1,164
= Net Operating Income                $1,164
- Debt Service (75% LTV @ 7.5%)      - $1,087
= Monthly Cash Flow                   $77
```

### Quick ROI Check
```
Purchase Price                        $150,000
× 70% (Max for good deal)            × 0.70
= Maximum Investment                  $105,000
- Renovation                          - $45,000
= Maximum Allowable Offer             $60,000

Your Offer: $150K
MAO: $60K
→ Won't flip well, but may hold well if rents strong
```

### Quick Appreciation Value
```
Current Value                         $290,000
× (1.04)^10 (4% for 10 years)        × 1.48024
= Future Value (Year 10)              $429,140
```

## 🔢 USEFUL FORMULAS

### Monthly Payment (Principal + Interest)
```
=PMT(rate/12, term*12, -loan_amount)

Example:
=PMT(0.075/12, 30*12, -217500)
= $1,531/month
```

### Future Value (With Appreciation)
```
=PV * (1 + rate)^years

Example:
=$290,000 * (1.04)^10
= $429,140
```

### Cap Rate
```
=NOI / Property_Value

Example:
=$15,534 / $204,050
= 7.6%
```

### Cash-on-Cash Return
```
=Annual_Cash_Flow / Initial_Investment

Example:
=$2,469 / $72,525
= 3.4% (Year 1 only)
```

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio
```
=NOI / Annual_Debt_Service

Example:
=$15,534 / $13,065
= 1.19x
```

### Execution Errors

❌ Inadequate reserves (6+ months minimum)  
❌ Wrong market (research neighborhood trends)
