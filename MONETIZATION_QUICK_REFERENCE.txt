===============================================================================
  CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
===============================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE DECISIONS (This Week)
   - Which platform launches first? → LABOR
   - Final pricing strategy? → See ANALYSIS.md
   - Stripe live or test first? → Test, then live
   - Database migration plan? → See CHECKLIST.md

2. PHASE 1 EXECUTION (Weeks 3-6)
   - Stripe SDK installed + test account configured
   - Database schema: Add subscription_tier, api_key, usage_quota
   - Feature flag system operational
   - Rate limiter configured per-tier

3. PHASE 2 LAUNCH (Weeks 7-10)
   - Subscription portal live (upgrade/downgrade/cancel)
   - API key management
   - Usage metering & quotas enforced
   - Billing history visible to users

4. GO/NO-GO CRITERIA
   - Payment processing: 98%+ success rate
   - Feature gating: All tier features correctly hidden/shown
   - Rate limiting: Per-tier limits enforced
   - Documentation: Clear pricing & feature table for each tier

===============================================================================
  REVENUE PROJECTIONS
===============================================================================

CONSERVATIVE:  Year 1: $142M   Year 2: $280M   Year 3: $560M
BASE CASE:     Year 1: $290M   Year 2: $580M   Year 3: $1.0B
OPTIMISTIC:    Year 1: $490M   Year 2: $980M   Year 3: $1.5B

Most likely: $290M Year 1 (base case)

Break-even occurs around Month 8 if you build in months 1-3 and launch in month 4

===============================================================================
  KEY METRICS TO TRACK
===============================================================================

FINANCIAL:
  - MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) → Should grow 20-30% month-over-month
  - Churn Rate → Target <5% (good SaaS is 5-7%)
  - Customer Acquisition Cost → Target <$100 consumer, <$5K enterprise
  - Lifetime Value → Target >3× CAC
  - Average Revenue Per User → Should increase with upsells

PRODUCT:
  - Free-to-paid conversion rate → Target 10-15%
  - Feature adoption by tier → Reveals which tiers are sticky
  - Usage by tier → High usage = good fit
  - Time-to-value → Get to "aha moment" in <48 hours

OPERATIONAL:
  - Onboarding funnel → Measure drop-off points
  - Support ticket volume → Should stay <1 per 100 users
  - Payment success rate → Stripe delivers 98%+
  - Webhook reliability → Stripe → Your DB should be 99.9%

===============================================================================
  RISKS (And Mitigations)
===============================================================================

1. USER RESISTANCE TO PAID MODEL
   → Mitigation: Generous free tier (14 days full access)
   → Mitigation: Clear ROI documentation

2. FEATURE PARITY ISSUES
   → Mitigation: Comprehensive feature flag testing
   → Mitigation: Manual QA per tier

3. PAYMENT PROCESSING FAILURES
   → Mitigation: Use Stripe (99.99% uptime)
   → Mitigation: Fallback to PayPal for backup

4. CHURN FROM MIGRATION
   → Mitigation: Grandfather existing users at discounted rates
   → Mitigation: Dedicated onboarding for Enterprise

5. INCOMPLETE ENTERPRISE FEATURES
   → Mitigation: SSO/SAML by Month 4
   → Mitigation: White-labeling Phase 3
