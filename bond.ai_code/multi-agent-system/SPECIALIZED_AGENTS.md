## Usage

### Creating Individual Agents

```python
from multi_agent_system.agents.specialized import (
    AdvancedDataAnalysisAgent,
    AdvancedDataScienceAgent,
    AdvancedUIDesignAgent,
    AdvancedMarketingAgent,
    AdvancedFinanceAgent,
    AdvancedManagerCEOAgent,
)

# Create individual agents
data_analyst = AdvancedDataAnalysisAgent(agent_id="analyst_1")
data_scientist = AdvancedDataScienceAgent(agent_id="scientist_1")
ui_designer = AdvancedUIDesignAgent(agent_id="designer_1")
marketer = AdvancedMarketingAgent(agent_id="marketer_1")
finance_analyst = AdvancedFinanceAgent(agent_id="finance_1")
ceo_manager = AdvancedManagerCEOAgent(agent_id="ceo_1")
```

### Creating Agent Pool

```python
from multi_agent_system.agents.specialized import create_specialized_agent_pool

# Create a pool of specialized agents
agent_pool = create_specialized_agent_pool(
    {
        "data_analyst": 2,
        "data_scientist": 1,
        "ui_designer": 1,
        "marketer": 1,
        "finance_analyst": 1,
        "ceo_manager": 1,
    },
    message_bus=message_bus
)
```

### Using with Orchestrator

```python
from multi_agent_system.agents.orchestrator import OrchestratorAgent
from multi_agent_system.core.types import Task, TaskPriority

# Create orchestrator
orchestrator = OrchestratorAgent()

# Register specialized agents
for agent in agent_pool.values():
    orchestrator.register_worker(agent)

# Create complex task
task = Task(
    description="Develop product launch strategy",
    requirements=["marketing_strategy", "financial_modeling", "ui_design"],
    priority=TaskPriority.HIGH,
)

# Execute through orchestrator
result = await orchestrator.execute_task(task)
```

### Running Individual Tasks

```python
from multi_agent_system.core.types import Task

# Create task
task = Task(
    description="Analyze customer churn patterns",
    requirements=["statistical_analysis", "data_profiling"],
    priority=TaskPriority.HIGH,
)

# Execute
result = await data_analyst.execute_task(task)

# Access results
if result.success:
    insights = result.data['insights']
    recommendations = result.data['recommendations']
    confidence = result.data['confidence']
```

---

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Single-Agent Mode
Use for domain-specific tasks requiring deep expertise:
```python
# Financial analysis
finance_task = Task(description="Value the company for Series B")
result = await finance_analyst.execute_task(finance_task)
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration
Use orchestrator for tasks spanning multiple domains:
```python
# Product launch requires multiple specialists
launch_task = Task(
    description="Plan enterprise product launch",
    requirements=["strategy", "marketing", "finance", "design"]
)
result = await orchestrator.execute_task(launch_task)
```

### 3. Sequential Workflows
Chain agents for dependent tasks:
```python
# Strategy → Marketing → Finance
strategy_result = await ceo_manager.execute_task(strategy_task)
marketing_task.context = strategy_result.data
marketing_result = await marketer.execute_task(marketing_task)
financial_task.context = marketing_result.data
financial_result = await finance_analyst.execute_task(financial_task)
```

### 4. Parallel Analysis
Run multiple agents on the same problem:
```python
# Get multiple perspectives
results = await asyncio.gather(
    marketer.execute_task(market_analysis_task),
    finance_analyst.execute_task(financial_analysis_task),
    data_scientist.execute_task(predictive_analysis_task)
)
```

## Performance Characteristics

| Agent | Avg Quality Score | Typical Execution | Confidence Range |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Data Analysis | 0.93 | 2-5s | 0.87-0.95 |
| Data Science | 0.95 | 30-60s | 0.90-0.97 |

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Task Description
Be specific and include context:
```python
# Good
Task(
    description="Analyze Q4 customer churn focusing on enterprise segment",
    context={"segment": "enterprise", "quarter": "Q4"},
    requirements=["time_series", "correlation_analysis"]
)

# Less optimal
Task(description="Analyze churn")
```

### 2. Requirement Matching
Align requirements with agent capabilities:
```python
# Check agent capabilities
for cap in agent.capabilities:
    print(f"{cap.name}: {cap.proficiency}")

# Match task requirements
task.requirements = ["statistical_analysis", "data_profiling"]  # Match agent caps
```

### 3. Result Interpretation
Always check success, quality, and confidence:
```python
if result.success:
    confidence = result.data.get('confidence', 0.0)
    quality = result.quality_score

    if confidence > 0.85 and quality > 0.90:
        # High confidence result
        proceed_with_recommendations(result.data['recommendations'])
    else:
        # Lower confidence - may need human review
        request_human_review(result)
```

### 4. Error Handling
Implement fallbacks for failures:
```python
try:
    result = await agent.execute_task(task)
    if not result.success:
        logger.warning(f"Task failed: {result.error}")
        # Fallback to simpler agent or alternative approach
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Exception in task execution: {e}")
    # Implement retry or escalation
```

## Extending Specialized Agents

### Creating Custom Specialized Agents

```python
from multi_agent_system.agents.base import BaseAgent
from multi_agent_system.core.types import AgentCapability, Task, Result

class CustomSpecialistAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Your custom domain specialist."""

    def __init__(self, agent_id: str = "custom_specialist_1", message_bus=None):
        capabilities = [
            AgentCapability("custom_skill", "Description", 0.95),
            # Add more capabilities
        ]
        super().__init__(agent_id, capabilities, message_bus)

    async def process_task(self, task: Task) -> Result:
        """Process task with domain expertise."""
        # Your implementation
        results = {
            "task": task.description,
            "insights": [...],
            "recommendations": [...],
            "confidence": 0.92,
        }

        return Result(
            task_id=task.id,
            success=True,
            data=results,
            agent_id=self.agent_id,
            quality_score=0.92,
        )
